         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>BRUS­SELS — The high­est court in the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion de­cid­ed on Tues­day that Google must grant us­ers of its search en­gine a right to de­lete links about them­selves in some cases, in­clud­ing links to le­gal records.</p> <p>The <a title=\"PDF\" href=\"http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-05/cp140070en.pdf\">de­ci­sion</a> by the Eu­ro­pean Court of Jus­tice in Lux­em­bourg is a blow for Google, which has sought to avoid the ob­li­ga­tion to re­move links when re­quest­ed by Eu­ro­pean us­ers of its serv­ice.</p> <p>By rul­ing that an In­ter­net com­pa­ny like Google must com­ply with Eu­ro­pean pri­vacy laws when op­er­at­ing in the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion — a con­sumer mar­ket of about 550 mil­lion peo­ple — the court is in­di­cat­ing that such com­pa­nies must op­er­ate in a fun­da­men­tal­ly dif­fer­ent way than they do in the Unit­ed States.</p> <p>In­stead of op­er­at­ing as a sin­gle around-the-world, around-the-clock forum for oth­er peo­ple’s in­for­ma­tion, Google — and po­ten­tial­ly com­pa­nies like Face­book and prob­a­bly Twit­ter — would need in the 28 Eu­ro­pean Un­ion coun­tries to be­come more ac­tive­ly in­volved in ref­er­ee­ing com­plaints from us­ers about in­for­ma­tion car­ried on­line. The com­pa­nies would al­so as­sume the re­spon­si­bil­ity and cost for re­mov­ing that in­for­ma­tion if re­quest­ed to do so by na­tion­al da­ta of­fi­cials on be­half of peo­ple rais­ing com­plaints.</p> <p>‘'This sounds like a land­mark judg­ment,'’ said Pe­ter Hus­tinx, a top Eu­ro­pean Un­ion of­fi­cial for da­ta pro­tec­tion. “The court is say­ing that Google isn’t just sell­ing ad­verts in Eu­rope, but is pro­vid­ing con­tent along with those ser­vices. If you are a reg­u­lar cit­i­zen, it gives you a rem­edy any­where in Eu­rope for you to ask com­pa­nies to take down con­tent con­nect­ed to you.'’</p> <p>The rul­ing would ap­ply on­ly to Eu­rope and prob­a­bly have no ef­fect for us­ers of Google or oth­er digi­tal me­dia ser­vices in the Unit­ed States, where free­dom of speech in many cases over­rides pri­vacy con­sid­er­a­tions, as­sum­ing the in­for­ma­tion is ac­cu­rate. But Eu­rope tends to strike more of a bal­ance be­tween speech and pri­vacy rights.</p> <p>And in Tues­day’s rul­ing the Eu­ro­pean court in­di­cat­ed that in­di­vid­u­als may have the right to have links to un­flat­ter­ing ma­terial re­moved from the In­ter­net even if the orig­i­nal was true and le­gally post­ed. The case in­volved a law­yer in Spain who had sought to have links re­moved to on­line news­pa­per ac­counts from the 1990s of his debt and tax trou­bles.</p> <p>The rul­ing comes as mo­men­tum builds in Eu­rope to adopt an even more far-reach­ing pri­vacy law al­ready un­der ne­go­ti­a­tion by law­mak­ers that in­cludes a tougher so-called right to be for­got­ten, or “era­sure” as it is termed in draft leg­is­la­tion, that al­so would ap­ply to com­pa­nies like Face­book. Help­ing dri­ve that im­pulse in the last year have been Ed­ward J. Snow­den’s rev­e­la­tions of da­ta pri­vacy in­tru­sions by the Unit­ed States Na­tion­al Se­cu­rity Agency and some oth­er in­ter­na­tion­al law en­force­ment agen­cies, which in some cases have in­volved glean­ing in­for­ma­tion col­lect­ed by In­ter­net com­pa­nies.</p> <p>The judg­ment on Tues­day was based on a da­ta pro­tec­tion law from 1995 that pro­vides lim­ited rights to ob­ject to the pro­cess­ing of per­sonal in­for­ma­tion and to de­mand its era­sure in cer­tain sit­u­a­tions.</p> <p>The court de­cid­ed that there were cases in which a com­pa­ny like Google should al­low on­line us­ers to be “for­got­ten” af­ter a cer­tain time by eras­ing links to web pages “un­less there are par­tic­u­lar rea­sons, such as the role played by the da­ta sub­ject in pub­lic life, jus­ti­fy­ing a pre­pon­der­ant in­ter­est of the pub­lic.”</p> <p>It ruled that com­pa­nies like Google could be “oblig­ed to re­move links to web pages” even when the orig­i­nal “pub­li­ca­tion in it­self on those pages is law­ful,” ac­cord­ing to a sum­mary of the judg­ment.</p> <p>In what ap­peared to be an en­dorse­ment of the ag­gres­sive ap­proach to pri­vacy pro­tec­tion in Eu­rope in the digi­tal age, the court said in its sum­mary that “the ef­fect of the in­ter­fer­ence with the per­son’s rights is height­ened on ac­count of the im­por­tant role played by the In­ter­net and search en­gines in mod­ern so­ci­ety.”</p> <p>Fa­vor­ing com­pa­nies like Google in such cir­cum­stances, the court said, could not “be jus­ti­fied by mere­ly the eco­nom­ic in­ter­est which the op­er­a­tor of the en­gine has in the da­ta pro­cess­ing.”</p> <p>Al Ver­ney, a spokes­man for Google, said in a state­ment that the de­ci­sion was “a dis­ap­point­ing rul­ing for search en­gines and on­line pub­lish­ers in gen­er­al,” and that the com­pa­ny would “take time” to an­a­lyze the im­pli­ca­tions. Google was “very sur­prised” that the judg­ment “dif­fers so dra­mat­i­cal­ly” from a pre­lim­i­nary rul­ing by the court last year that most­ly went in the com­pa­ny’s fa­vor, he said.</p> <p>A trade group for in­for­ma­tion tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies said the court’s de­ci­sion posed a threat to free ex­pres­sion in Eu­rope. ‘'This rul­ing opens the door to large-scale pri­vate cen­sor­ship in Eu­rope,'’ said James Wa­ter­worth, the head of the Brus­sels of­fice for the Com­puter and Com­mu­ni­ca­tions In­dus­try As­so­ci­a­tion, which has Face­book, Micro­soft and Google among its mem­bers, as well as Eu­ro­pean com­pa­nies like BT and T-Mo­bile. ‘'While the rul­ing like­ly means to of­fer pro­tec­tions, our con­cern is it could al­so be mis­used by politi­cians or oth­ers with some­thing to hide who could de­mand to have in­for­ma­tion taken down,'’ he said.</p> <p>The judg­ment on Tues­day re­versed what had seemed a <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/business/global/european-court-opinion-favors-google-in-privacy-battle.html\">pre­lim­i­nary vic­tory for Google</a> in June 2013, when an ad­viser to the court, Ni­ilo Jaask­i­nen, is­sued an opin­ion im­ply­ing that Google did not need to re­move the links.</p> <p>Be­cause the Eu­ro­pean Court of Jus­tice is the high­est court in the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion, Google can­not ap­peal Tues­day’s de­ci­sion.​</p> <p>Even as the Eu­ro­pean au­thori­ties fet­ed a vic­tory for their strict ap­proach to on­line pri­vacy pro­tec­tion, le­gal ex­perts asked whether the dri­ve by Brus­sels to in­tro­duce a tougher law was still nec­es­sary af­ter such a sweep­ing rul­ing by the court.</p> <p>“Most sur­pris­ing is that the court has come down firm­ly in fa­vor of a ‘right to be for­got­ten,' ” said Rich­ard Cum­b­ley, a Lon­don-based part­ner at the law firm Lin­klaters. “Given that the E.U. has spent two years de­bat­ing this right as part of the re­form of E.U. pri­vacy leg­is­la­tion, it is iron­ic that the E.C.J. has found it al­ready ex­ists in such a strik­ing man­ner,” he said, re­fer­ring to the Eu­ro­pean Court of Jus­tice.</p> <p>But Mi­na An­dree­va, a spokes­woman for the Eu­ro­pean Com­mis­sion, the ad­min­is­tra­tive arm of the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion, told a news con­fer­ence on Tues­day af­ter­noon that in­cor­po­rat­ing the rul­ing in­to new leg­is­la­tion was still nec­es­sary.</p> <p>The leg­is­la­tion, Ms. An­dree­va said, would make it clear that a right to be for­got­ten is avail­able to Eu­ro­pean us­ers whose da­ta was car­ried by non-Eu­ro­pean com­pa­nies — even those com­pa­nies that do not have a phys­i­cal pres­ence, like a com­puter server, in Eu­rope. The new rules would al­so put an ob­li­ga­tion on com­pa­nies, rather than us­ers as is cur­rent­ly the case, to prove whether da­ta were still need­ed to be kept on­line. “To­day, it’s up to con­sumers to prove this, but this is not very easy or ef­fec­tive,” she said. “We have re­versed the bur­den of proof.”</p> <p>While the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion has taken a glob­al lead in pur­su­ing da­ta pri­vacy rules, many oth­er for­eign au­thori­ties — in­clud­ing Brazil and Malaysia — have been watch­ing close­ly and even adopt­ing their own reg­u­la­tions. That por­tends an even fur­ther frag­ment­ed set of poli­cies that Amer­i­can In­ter­net gi­ants will en­coun­ter as they op­er­ate around the world. Brazil passed a law last month that forces tech­nol­ogy com­pa­nies to re­move on­line ma­terial if lo­cal courts rule that it is of­fen­sive or li­bel­ous.</p> <p>The Eu­ro­pean case be­gan in 2009 when Mario Coste­ja, the law­yer in Spain, ob­ject­ed that en­ter­ing his name in Google’s search en­gine led to le­gal no­tices dat­ing back to 1998 in an on­line ver­sion of a Span­ish news­pa­per that de­tailed his ac­cu­mu­lated debts and the forced sale of his prop­erty.</p> <p>Mr. Coste­ja said that the debt is­sues had been re­solved many years ear­lier and were no longer rel­e­vant.</p> <p>When the news­pa­per that had pub­lished the in­for­ma­tion, La Van­guardia, re­fused to re­move the no­tices, and when Google re­fused to ex­punge the links, Mr. Coste­ja com­plained to the Span­ish Da­ta Pro­tec­tion Agency that his rights to the pro­tec­tion of his per­sonal da­ta were be­ing vi­o­lat­ed.</p> <p>The Span­ish au­thor­ity or­dered Google to re­move the links in Ju­ly 2010, but it did not im­pose any or­der on La Van­guardia.</p> <p>Google chal­lenged the or­der, and the Na­tion­al High Court of Spain re­ferred the case to the Eu­ro­pean court for ad­vice on how to rule.</p> <p>In his ad­vi­so­ry con­clu­sion, which the Eu­ro­pean court did not end up fol­low­ing, Mr. Jaask­i­nen had con­clud­ed that be­cause Google mere­ly ag­gre­gated in­for­ma­tion on the web and was a “proces­sor'’ of in­for­ma­tion and not a “con­trol­ler” of it — the com­pa­ny was not the le­gal en­tity that must com­ply with the pro­vi­sion of the law in ques­tion. Mr. Jaask­i­nen al­so said that the 1995 law guar­an­teed a right to be for­got­ten on­ly in cases where in­for­ma­tion was in­com­plete or in­ac­cu­rate, which was not at is­sue in the Span­ish case.</p> <p>But the court deemed oth­er­wise on Tues­day, rul­ing that Google is a con­trol­ler of in­for­ma­tion — a dis­tinc­tion that, ac­cord­ing to the court, means Google must com­ply with Eu­ro­pean pri­vacy rules when op­er­at­ing in Eu­rope.</p> <p>Tues­day’s rul­ing, while in­di­cat­ing what the new le­gal frame­work will be for de­cid­ing such is­sues in Eu­ro­pean Un­ion mem­ber states, sent the orig­i­nal case back to the Span­ish court to set­tle Mr. Coste­ja’s com­plaint. What­ever the Span­ish court might de­cide in terms of La Van­guardia’s ob­li­ga­tion to re­move the dis­put­ed ma­terial from its data­base, Mr. Coste­ja’s law­yer said it was a vic­tory be­cause Google would be re­quired to re­move the on­line links.</p> <p>‘'We’ve very hap­py be­cause even though we were con­fi­dent all along, this has been a very dif­fi­cult process, given the mas­sive means that Google could use'’ to de­fend it­self, said Joaquín Mu­ñoz, a part­ner at Aban­lex, a Span­ish law firm that spe­cial­izes in tech­nol­ogy cases. ‘'The fun­da­men­tal point is that con­sumers will now know what the rules of the game are and how to de­fend their rights.'’</p> <p>​ ​</p> </div>",

Mr. Ban said the res­ig­na­tion was ef­fec­tive at the end of May.</p> <p>“Mr. Brahi­mi has long been rec­og­nized as one of the world’s most bril­liant diplo­mats,” Mr. Ban said. The res­ig­na­tion, he said, “is a fail­ure for all of us.”</p> <p>Mr. Brahi­mi thanked Mr. Ban and told re­porters the res­ig­na­tion “was not a very pleas­ant sit­u­a­tion for me.”</p> <p>His res­ig­na­tion came amid ris­ing frus­tra­tion with Pres­i­dent Ba­shar al-As­sad of Syria, who ig­nored Mr. Brahi­mi’s pro­posed agen­da for talks and then sched­uled a pres­i­den­tial elec­tion that will prob­a­bly in­stall him for an­other seven-year term. Top Unit­ed Na­tions of­fi­cials had ex­pressed dis­may at the move, say­ing the elec­tion would prob­a­bly sab­o­tage any fur­ther diplo­ma­cy.</p> <p>Mr. Brahi­mi told the Se­cu­rity Coun­cil in mid-March that there was no point in stay­ing on in his role if Mr. As­sad went ahead with a vote. Mr. As­sad <a title=\"Times article\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/22/world/middleeast/syria.html\">re­spond­ed by set­ting a date in ear­ly June</a>.</p> <p>“There’s no point in ask­ing the poor guy to keep hang­ing on in­def­i­nite­ly,” said a Unit­ed Na­tions dip­lo­mat who spoke on the con­di­tion of an­o­nym­ity be­cause of diplo­mat­ic pro­to­col about the an­nounce­ment.</p> <p>Mr. Brahi­mi led the gov­ern­ment and op­po­si­tion rep­re­sen­ta­tives in two rounds of talks in Switz­er­land. The last end­ed with­out agree­ment even on an agen­da for talks. Elec­tions would de­fy one of the cen­tral premis­es for the ne­go­ti­a­tions: to dis­cuss how to form an in­terim tran­si­tion­al gov­ern­ment.</p> <p>There is no agree­ment on who might suc­ceed Mr. Brahi­mi, nor how a suc­ces­sor might pro­ceed. Diplo­mats are de­bat­ing whether it would help to in­stall an­other high pro­file fig­ure, or choose some­one less known.</p> <p>Sev­eral diplo­mats have said a break­through on Syria will come on­ly if Iran, the As­sad gov­ern­ment’s most im­por­tant backer in the Mid­dle East, can be per­suad­ed to co­oper­ate on a po­lit­i­cal set­tle­ment.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>In the midst of all the tur­moil in health care these days, one thing is be­com­ing clear: No mat­ter what kind of health plan con­sumers choose, they will find few­er doc­tors and hos­pi­tals in their net­work — or pay much more for the priv­i­lege of go­ing to any provider they want.</p> <p>These so-called nar­row net­works, fea­tur­ing lim­it­ed groups of providers, have made a big en­trance on the new­ly cre­at­ed state in­sur­ance ex­changes, where they are a com­mon fea­ture in many of the plans. While the sizes of the net­works vary con­sid­er­ably, many plans now ex­clude at least some large hos­pi­tals or doc­tors’ groups. Small­er net­works are al­so be­com­ing more com­mon in health care cov­er­age of­fered by em­ploy­ers and in pri­vate Medicare Ad­van­tage plans.</p> <p>In­sur­ers, rang­ing from na­tion­al be­he­moths like Well­Point, Unit­ed­Health and Aet­na to much small­er lo­cal car­ri­ers, are ful­ly em­brac­ing the idea, say­ing nar­row­er net­works are es­sen­tial to con­trol­ling costs and man­ag­ing care. Ma­jor play­ers con­tend they can avoid the up­roar that crip­pled a sim­i­lar push in the 1990s.</p> <p>“We have to break peo­ple away from the choice habit that every­one has,” said Mar­cus Merz, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Pre­ferre­dOne, an in­sur­er in Gold­en Val­ley, Minn., that is owned by two health sys­tems and a physi­cian group. “We’re all try­ing to break away from this fix­a­tion on open ac­cess and broad net­works.”</p> <p>But while there is ev­i­dence that con­sumers are will­ing to sac­ri­fice some choice in fa­vor of low­er prices, many crit­ics, in­clud­ing po­lit­i­cal op­po­nents of the new health care law, re­main wary about nar­row­ing net­works. A con­cern is that in­sur­ers will lim­it ac­cess to spe­cial­ists or cer­tain hos­pi­tals. “Too of­ten, Oba­macare can­cels the pol­i­cy you want­ed to keep and tells you what pol­i­cy to buy,” Sen­a­tor Lamar Alexan­der, a Ten­nessee Re­pub­li­can, said in a speech in April.</p> <p>Dr. Mon­i­ca We­h­by, a pe­di­atric neu­ro­sur­geon, is us­ing the po­ten­tial re­ac­tion to nar­row­er net­works as mo­men­tum for her cam­paign for Sen­ate in Ore­gon. A Re­pub­li­can promis­ing to re­peal the Af­ford­able Care Act, her slo­gan is “Keep your doc­tor. Change your sen­a­tor.”</p> <p>Oth­er com­plaints in­volve con­fu­sion over which providers are par­tic­i­pat­ing in which plans.</p> <p>“The thing you’re buy­ing is ac­cess to the provider net­work,” said Lynn Quin­cy, a pol­i­cy ex­pert at Con­sumers Union. “Right now it feels like you’re forced to guess.”</p> <p>In re­sponse, state and fed­er­al reg­u­la­tors say they are more close­ly mon­i­tor­ing the plans be­ing of­fered in the com­ing year to be sure they are clear and that con­sumers have suf­fi­cient ac­cess to hos­pi­tals and doc­tors. In some cas­es, they are al­ready in­sist­ing on changes.</p> <p>Nonethe­less, for peo­ple who are di­rect­ly pick­ing plans in the open mar­kets, in­sur­ers say price is turn­ing out to be crit­i­cal. Peo­ple “are weigh­ing af­ford­abil­i­ty and breadth of net­work,” said Karen Ig­nag­ni, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Amer­i­ca’s Health In­sur­ance Plans, an in­dus­try trade group. “What we’re find­ing is in­di­vid­u­als are ex­pe­ri­enc­ing a pref­er­ence for af­ford­abil­i­ty,” she said.</p> <p>Min­neso­ta would seem to be a case in point.</p> <p>On the state ex­change, Pre­ferre­dOne of­fered an in­ex­pen­sive plan with a net­work of 13 hos­pi­tals, but those low pre­mi­ums helped the in­sur­er grab 60 per­cent of the in­di­vid­ual in­sur­ance mar­ket.</p> <p>While many in­sur­ers are in­clud­ing on­ly those hos­pi­tals and doc­tors will­ing to charge low­er prices, ex­perts say the make­up of the net­works is like­ly to evolve over time, fo­cus­ing less di­rect­ly on price and more on the abil­i­ty of providers to de­liv­er co­or­di­nat­ed and high-qual­i­ty care.</p> <p>Al­though a sim­i­lar at­tempt to re­strict choice failed in the ear­ly ‘90s, af­ter op­po­si­tion to H.M.O.s and man­aged care, in­sur­ers in­sist these ef­forts will not run in­to the same re­sis­tance be­cause they are now work­ing more close­ly with providers, and cus­tomers are more con­cerned about costs. “It’s a new era,” said Dr. Sam Ho, the chief med­ical of­fi­cer for Unit­ed Health­care.</p> <p>Oth­ers agree. “You’re go­ing to see this as a dom­i­nant strat­e­gy,” said Jeff Hoff­man, who works close­ly with hos­pi­tals for Kurt Salmon, a con­sult­ing firm.</p> <p>Blue Shield of Cal­i­for­nia, for ex­am­ple, was able to re­cruit a fair­ly siz­able group of providers in­ter­est­ed in dis­count­ing their rates. Just as the plans must com­pete on the ex­changes, “the doc­tors and hos­pi­tals are com­pet­ing with each oth­er to get in,” said Juan Davi­la, an ex­ec­u­tive vice pres­i­dent with the in­sur­er. The next step, Mr. Davi­la said, is to work with providers to de­vel­op more so­phis­ti­cat­ed net­works, where the in­sur­er will team with those doc­tors and hos­pi­tals to pro­vide bet­ter care.</p> <p>Out­side the ex­changes, in­sur­ers are al­so pro­mot­ing small­er net­works for em­ploy­ers as a way to re­duce over­all health care costs, said Lar­ry Boress, chief ex­ec­u­tive of the Mid­west Busi­ness Group on Health. “The larg­er the net­work is, the high­er the cost,” he said.</p> <p>Em­ploy­ers re­main con­cerned about the qual­i­ty of the net­works, said Mr. Boress, and many are do­ing an analy­sis to see how dis­rup­tive chang­ing the net­work would be for their work­ers.</p> <p>Nonethe­less, the bot­tom line is that more em­ploy­ers are con­sid­er­ing small­er net­works. Many, like Wal­mart and Gen­er­al Elec­tric, have gone so far as to steer em­ploy­ees to spe­cif­ic hos­pi­tals for cer­tain ex­pen­sive pro­ce­dures like joint re­place­ments.</p> <p>In 2010, 24 per­cent of the largest em­ploy­ers of­fered small­er net­works, cho­sen for their low costs or qual­i­ty. Last year, 27 per­cent of­fered them and 44 per­cent said they were con­sid­er­ing them, ac­cord­ing to Mer­cer, a ben­e­fits con­sult­ing firm. Some com­pa­nies are ex­per­i­ment­ing with dif­fer­ent tiers of net­works, charg­ing work­ers more if they go to the broad­est net­work, said Joseph Kra, a Mer­cer con­sul­tant.</p> <p>There has been push­back, how­ev­er. When Unit­ed Health­care re­duced the size of net­works in some Medicare Ad­van­tage plans, con­sumer groups and reg­u­la­tors balked. Dr. Ho, the chief med­ical of­fi­cer, said the in­sur­er of­fered pa­tients the op­por­tu­ni­ty to con­tin­ue re­ceiv­ing cer­tain treat­ments, like chemother­a­py, with their ex­ist­ing provider.</p> <p>Medicare re­cent­ly an­nounced it would re­quire Ad­van­tage plans to give ad­vance no­tice of any sig­nif­i­cant changes to a net­work and might al­low ben­e­fi­cia­ries to switch dur­ing the year if the net­work un­der­went too much change af­ter they had al­ready signed up. Fed­er­al of­fi­cials, who had float­ed the idea of re­quir­ing ex­change plans to sub­mit their net­works for re­view, said they would in­stead fo­cus on spe­cif­ic types of doc­tors, like can­cer spe­cial­ists, to make sure peo­ple have ad­e­quate ac­cess to care. </p> <p>“We in­tend to con­tin­ue mon­i­tor­ing plans,” a Medicare spokes­woman said in a state­ment, “and learn from that re­view, to de­ter­mine if fur­ther rules are need­ed in the com­ing years to en­sure that Mar­ket­place plans of­fer qual­i­ty net­works to con­sumers.”</p> <p>State reg­u­la­tors are al­so con­tem­plat­ing ac­tion. In Wash­ing­ton State, Mike Krei­dler, the in­sur­ance reg­u­la­tor, is­sued new rules last month that set cer­tain min­i­mum stan­dards for ac­cess to a doc­tor and re­quire in­sur­ers to make clear who is in the net­work. “I want to make sure car­ri­ers are not in a race to the bot­tom,” he said.</p> <p>Af­ter much de­bate, New York reg­u­la­tors <a title=\"Related Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/nyregion/new-york-will-keep-affordable-care-act-health-plans-restricted.html\">de­cid­ed last </a> <a title=\"Related Times article.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/nyregion/new-york-will-keep-affordable-care-act-health-plans-restricted.html\">month</a> not to re­quire health plans to of­fer out-of-net­work ben­e­fits in 2015, de­spite pres­sure from pa­tients and doc­tors.</p> <p>New Hamp­shire reg­u­la­tors are al­so try­ing to weigh in on the de­ci­sion by the state’s on­ly in­sur­er, Well­Point, to ex­clude some hos­pi­tals.</p> <p>In Wash­ing­ton, Seat­tle Chil­dren’s Hos­pi­tal is chal­leng­ing state in­sur­ance reg­u­la­tors be­cause some of the plans ex­clude it.</p> <p>Reg­u­la­tors are al­so work­ing with in­sur­ers to make it clear­er which providers are in­clud­ed in a net­work.</p> <p>De­spite some of the re­sis­tance, in­sur­ers say they think peo­ple will grow ac­cus­tomed to choos­ing a plan based on what net­work it of­fers rather than nec­es­sar­i­ly which in­sur­er sells it. “The net­work ex­pe­ri­ence be­comes the glue that holds it to­geth­er,” Mark T. Bertoli­ni, the chief ex­ec­u­tive of Aet­na, told in­vestors ear­li­er this year.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>WASH­ING­TON — As Iran and six world pow­ers meet this week in Vi­enna to be­gin draft­ing lan­guage to re­solve their nu­clear stand­off, ne­go­tia­tors say they are fi­nally con­fronting a cru­cial stick­ing point to a per­ma­nent agree­ment — the size and shape of the nu­clear fu­el pro­duc­tion ca­pa­bil­ity that Iran will be per­mit­ted to re­tain.</p> <p>It is a sub­ject that, at least in pub­lic, the Oba­ma ad­min­is­tra­tion steps around, acute­ly aware that Is­rael and mem­bers of Con­gress who are high­ly sus­pi­cious of the ne­go­ti­a­tions will say that Iran must be kept years from be­ing able to de­velop a weapon, and that op­po­nents of the deal in Tehran will ar­gue that no re­straints at all should be im­posed.</p> <p>Both the Ira­ni­ans and the West­ern pow­ers have said their talks so far have been pro­duc­tive, with lit­tle of the dra­ma, the ul­ti­ma­tums and the en­trenched po­si­tions that have marked pre­vi­ous ef­forts. But un­til now, there has been no for­mal dis­cus­sion of how much nu­clear in­fra­struc­ture the Unit­ed States and its al­lies would de­mand that Iran dis­man­tle in re­turn for the grad­ual eas­ing of sanc­tions. “This is the stick­er-shock con­ver­sa­tion, and we ha­ven’t had it yet,” one sen­ior ad­min­is­tra­tion of­fi­cial said.</p> <p>In a visit to Is­rael last week, the na­tion­al se­cu­rity ad­viser, Su­san E. Rice, and the chief Amer­i­can ne­go­ti­a­tor, Wendy Sher­man, made clear that the Ira­ni­ans would al­most cer­tain­ly re­tain some en­rich­ment ca­pa­bil­ity, though Amer­i­can of­fi­cials said they nev­er dis­cussed spe­cific num­bers. Is­raeli of­fi­cials say they ex­pect the fig­ure to be 2,000 to 5,000 cen­tri­fuges. Amer­i­can of­fi­cials say their goal is to keep Iran more than a year away from the abil­i­ty to produce fu­el us­able in a sin­gle nu­clear weapon, but they be­come vague about how much be­yond one year. It would take even longer to fab­ri­cate that in­to a de­liv­er­able weapon.</p> <p>In a re­cent speech, Pres­i­dent Has­san Rouhani of Iran was care­ful to de­scribe him­self as open to more in­spec­tions, but not to dis­man­tling the coun­try’s nu­clear in­fra­struc­ture. “We have noth­ing to put on the ta­ble and of­fer to them but trans­par­ency,” he told his coun­try’s Atom­ic En­ergy Or­ga­ni­za­tion, ac­cord­ing to ac­counts from Ira­nian news or­ga­ni­za­tions. “That’s it. Our nu­clear tech­nol­ogy is not up for ne­go­ti­a­tion.”</p> <p>The Ira­ni­ans are talk­ing about ex­pand­ing their cur­rent cache, to build up­ward of 50,000 cen­tri­fuges, the tall, sil­very ma­chines that spin at su­per­son­ic speeds, en­rich­ing ura­nium at ev­ery turn. Iran cur­rent­ly has 19,000 in­stalled, in­clud­ing about 8,000 that are not yet run­ning. If Iran ever reached its goal — which is high­ly un­like­ly in the next few years, es­pe­cial­ly with a new gen­er­a­tion of cen­tri­fuges that produce fu­el much more quick­ly — Amer­i­can ex­perts say Iran would be able to produce weapons-grade ma­terial in weeks.</p> <p>“An en­rich­ment ca­pac­ity that large — in­deed, an en­rich­ment ca­pac­ity greater than a few thou­sand first-gen­er­a­tion cen­tri­fuges — would give Iran an un­ac­cept­ably rapid break­out ca­pa­bil­ity,” Robert Ein­horn, who un­til last year was a key mem­ber of the Iran ne­go­ti­at­ing team for the State De­part­ment, <a title=\"Robert Einhorn in The National Interest\" href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/feature/iran-needs-get-realistic-about-enrichment-10434\">wrote in The Na­tion­al In­ter­est</a> last week. If that was more than just a ne­go­ti­at­ing po­si­tion, he wrote, “it is a show­stop­per, and Iran must know that.”</p> <p>“Break­out ca­pa­bil­ity” — a phrase that means the abil­i­ty to quick­ly produce a bomb — de­pends on many fac­tors be­yond the num­ber of cen­tri­fuges left spin­ning in Iran. The size of Iran’s in­ven­tory of nu­clear fu­el, the fre­quen­cy and breadth of nu­clear in­spec­tions, and the abil­i­ty to de­tect se­cret fa­cil­i­ties (two have been dis­cov­ered in the past dec­ade) fac­tor in­to the equa­tion.</p> <p>As Ms. Rice and Ms. Sher­man have told Amer­i­can law­mak­ers and out­side ex­perts, the key is to leave Iran with a face-sav­ing nu­clear in­fra­struc­ture that would al­low its cler­ics and the na­tion’s Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guards com­man­ders the abil­i­ty to ar­gue that they have not given up the right to produce nu­clear fu­el, but with a small enough ca­pa­bil­ity that the White House can over­come Con­gres­sion­al ob­jec­tions.</p> <p>Al­lies of the Is­raeli prime min­is­ter, Ben­jamin Ne­tan­yahu, still an­gry that the Oba­ma ad­min­is­tra­tion kept them in the dark about the se­cret ne­go­ti­a­tions with Iran that led to the cur­rent round of talks, pub­licly set an enor­mous­ly high bar that they knew Amer­i­can ne­go­tia­tors could not clear. “There are two mod­els here: Libya and North Ko­rea,” said Yu­val Steinitz, Is­rael’s in­tel­li­gence min­is­ter, in an in­ter­view on Mon­day. “In Libya all the el­e­ments of the nu­clear pro­gram were hand­ed over to the Amer­i­cans and in­spec­tors” and left the coun­try, he said. “In North Ko­rea equip­ment was dis­man­tled, then built again,” he said, “and then came their nu­clear tests.”</p> <p>But Mr. Steinitz ac­knowl­edged that the Unit­ed States and its al­lies had made what he termed “rea­son­able progress” in get­ting the Ira­ni­ans to agree, at least in prin­ci­ple, to mod­i­fy­ing a heavy-wa­ter re­ac­tor near the town of Arak that could be used to produce weapons-grade plu­to­ni­um, an­other path to a bomb. The head of Iran’s atom­ic or­ga­ni­za­tion, Ali Akhbar Sale­hi, has said his agency is will­ing to mod­i­fy plans for Arak to re­duce out­put sig­nif­i­cant­ly, in­di­cat­ing some ne­go­ti­at­ing space. But there has been al­most no progress on Iran’s mis­sile ca­pa­bil­ity; on Mon­day, Iran’s su­preme leader, Ay­a­tol­lah Ali Khamenei, called West­ern de­mands for lim­its on mis­siles “stu­pid and id­i­otic.”</p> <p>Even as the ne­go­tia­tors de­bate the size and scope of the Ira­nian nu­clear pro­gram, a new study of Iran’s emerg­ing use of cy­ber­weapons con­cludes that the coun­try is be­gin­ning to fol­low Chi­na’s model of us­ing com­puter mal­ware to con­duct es­pi­o­nage against Amer­i­can de­fense con­trac­tors and the gov­ern­ment.</p> <p>But the at­tacks from “pa­tri­otic hack­ers” whose ex­act links to the Ira­nian gov­ern­ment and its Rev­o­lu­tion­ary Guards re­main murky, ap­peared to slow for a time at the end of 2013, as the ne­go­ti­a­tions with the Unit­ed States and Eu­rope be­gan to gain some trac­tion, ac­cord­ing to the study by Fire­Eye, a Sil­i­con Val­ley se­cu­rity firm. The find­ings were first re­port­ed by Reuters, and a copy of the study was ob­tained by The New York Times.</p> <p>The study fo­cus­es on what Ira­nian hack­ers call the Ajax Se­cu­rity Team, which it says is “con­duct­ing mul­ti­ple cy­beres­pi­onage op­er­a­tions against com­pa­nies in the de­fense in­dus­trial base with­in the Unit­ed States” and is tar­get­ing Ira­ni­ans try­ing to evade cen­sor­ship at home.</p> <p>Ira­nian of­fi­cials have made clear that they view the cy­ber and nu­clear is­sues as close­ly re­lated, es­pe­cial­ly af­ter Iran suf­fered a de­bil­i­tat­ing at­tack, known pop­u­lar­ly as Stuxnet or by its code name, Olympic Games, which was de­signed by the Unit­ed States and Is­rael.</p> <p>The cy­ber­at­tacks led Iran to an­nounce it was as­sem­bling a “cy­ber corps.” While their tech­niques do not com­pare to those of the Chi­nese or the Rus­sians, Ira­nian hack­ers were de­ter­mined to have been be­hind a 2012 at­tack on Sau­di Aram­co, the oil pro­ducer. Iran was al­so be­lieved to have been re­spon­si­ble for an at­tack on the Navy Ma­rine Corps In­tranet that did lit­tle dam­age, but was con­sid­ered a bold chal­lenge.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>TAL­LA­HAS­SEE, Fla. — Af­ter liv­ing near­ly a half cen­tu­ry in the Unit­ed States — mar­ry­ing and rais­ing a fam­ily here, pay­ing tax­es and work­ing for decades for the fed­eral gov­ern­ment — Mario Her­nan­dez made a dis­cov­ery re­cent­ly that rat­tled him to his core: He is not an Amer­i­can cit­i­zen. In fact, he is not even a Unit­ed States res­i­dent.</p> <p>No­body had ever told him. Not his moth­er or his grand­par­ents. Not the Unit­ed States Army, where he served for three years in the 1970s. Not the elec­tion su­per­vi­sors in four states who tal­lied his votes in ev­ery ma­jor elec­tion since Jim­my Carter won the White House. Not the two state agen­cies where he was em­ployed, one in Wash­ing­ton State and the oth­er in Flori­da. And not the two fed­eral agen­cies, in­clud­ing the Jus­tice De­part­ment, where he spent most of his ca­reer as a prison su­per­vi­sor han­dling no­to­ri­ous in­mates and un­der­go­ing thor­ough back­ground checks ev­ery five years. Cit­i­zen­ship is a re­quire­ment for the job.</p> <p>The rev­e­la­tion came on­ly af­ter Mr. Her­nan­dez and his wife, Boni­ta, start­ed plan­ning a trip to cel­e­brate his re­cent re­tire­ment from the Bu­reau of Pris­ons af­ter 22 years. The two had set­tled on a Ca­rib­bean cruise, which would have been Mr. Her­nan­dez’s first time out of the coun­try since ar­riv­ing in 1965 as a Cu­ban ref­u­gee. On a cruise line web­site, he found out that a Unit­ed States pass­port was a re­quire­ment. He did not have one and won­dered whether he even had nat­u­ral­iza­tion pa­pers.</p> <p>“I thought I was a cit­i­zen — I’ve al­ways been proud of be­ing a cit­i­zen,” said Mr. Her­nan­dez, 58, the fa­ther of two grown chil­dren, one an en­gi­neer who is an Af­ghan war vet­eran. “This has re­al­ly messed with my head.”</p> <p>At a time when im­mi­gra­tion over­haul re­mains on the ta­ble in Con­gress, Mr. Her­nan­dez’s plight is the lat­est ex­am­ple, and one of the more ex­treme, of how large fed­eral bu­reau­cra­cies can stum­ble when it comes to iden­ti­fy­ing who is here le­gally, il­le­gal­ly or some­where in be­tween. With so many im­mi­grants in the coun­try un­der so many vary­ing rules, keep­ing track can some­times pose mon­u­men­tal chal­lenges.</p> <p>For Mr. Her­nan­dez, the con­se­quences are wor­ri­some. De­por­ta­tion is not some­thing he would face as a Cu­ban ref­u­gee and mil­i­tary vet­eran. But he can no longer vote, and he can­not leave the coun­try. And he could face prison and fines for hav­ing falsely claimed cit­i­zen­ship and for vot­ing.</p> <p>At the mo­ment, he ex­ists in im­mi­gra­tion lim­bo — not fully le­gal or il­le­gal. Af­ter he at­tend­ed an im­mi­gra­tion in­ter­view in March, his re­quest for cit­i­zen­ship was de­nied. It should not have been, said his law­yer, Eliz­a­beth Ric­ci, from Tal­la­has­see. Mr. Her­nan­dez was en­ti­tled to cit­i­zen­ship, she said, be­cause he had served in the Army dur­ing a “des­ig­nated pe­riod of hos­til­ity” at the end of the Viet­nam War era.</p> <p>A sec­ond let­ter from the im­mi­gra­tion serv­ice fol­lowed. It said the case would be re­opened but asked for more in­for­ma­tion, in­clud­ing why he had claimed to be a cit­i­zen, had reg­is­tered to vote and had vot­ed.</p> <p>Sharon Schei­d­hauer, a spokes­woman for Unit­ed States Cit­i­zen­ship and Im­mi­gra­tion Ser­vices, said the agency could not com­ment on in­di­vid­ual cases.</p> <p>“I think they are gravely em­bar­rassed,” Ms. Ric­ci said, “and are try­ing to shift the bur­den on him now to make him look like a crim­i­nal.” </p> <p>Not on­ly did Mr. Her­nan­dez work for the Bu­reau of Pris­ons (and be­fore that the Bu­reau of In­dian Af­fairs), but he had been a su­per­vi­sor, over­see­ing day-to-day op­er­a­tions, de­tainees and in­mates, in­clud­ing ter­ror­ists.</p> <p>By the time he re­tired, he had a desk full of com­men­da­tions. In 1995, he per­son­al­ly kept watch over the two Ok­la­homa City bombers, Ter­ry Nich­ols and Timo­thy Mc­Veigh, keep­ing an eye on each in their iso­la­tion cells for 12 hours a day on sep­a­rate weeks over the course of a month. When Willie Fal­con, the no­to­ri­ous co­caine traf­fick­er from Mi­ami, had to change pris­ons, Mr. Her­nan­dez was in charge of the trans­fer — one of sev­eral he over­saw in­volv­ing high-pro­file pris­on­ers.</p> <p>By all ac­counts, Mr. Her­nan­dez is a make-the-best-of-it kind of man who was taught to be self-re­li­ant at an ear­ly age. But he is un­nerved by the turn of events.</p> <p>“It’s like I’m liv­ing a bad dream,” he said as he sat in his com­fort­able home dec­o­rated with Hol­stein cow knick­knacks and dozens of framed pho­tographs of his chil­dren and grand­chil­dren. “This can­not be re­al; I’ve been liv­ing here 49 years. This is the on­ly coun­try I’ve ever known.”</p> <p>Eliz­a­beth C. Pines, a long­time im­mi­gra­tion law­yer in Mi­ami, said she had run across a hand­ful of sim­i­lar cases but none as ex­treme as this one.</p> <p>“It goes to show you how bro­ken the sys­tem is for a fed­eral and a state agency to have not even checked his back­ground — his crim­i­nal back­ground, yes, but not his im­mi­gra­tion back­ground,” she said.</p> <p>The on­ly im­mi­gra­tion doc­u­ment Mr. Her­nan­dez has is a pa­role doc­u­ment, which he re­ceived as a 9-year-old when he ar­rived at Mi­ami’s Free­dom Tow­er with his fam­ily. The pa­per al­lowed him to re­main in the Unit­ed States in­def­i­nite­ly.</p> <p>Cu­ban cit­i­zens are grant­ed spe­cial im­mi­gra­tion priv­i­leges when they flee Cu­ba and ar­rive in the Unit­ed States. First, they are grant­ed pa­role. Af­ter a year, un­less they are crim­i­nals, they can be­come Unit­ed States res­i­dents. Five years later, they can be­come Amer­i­can cit­i­zens. The on­ly hitch is that the pa­per­work must be filed, which Mr. Her­nan­dez’s par­ents nev­er did on his be­half.</p> <p>Grow­ing up in Fuller­ton, Calif., Mr. Her­nan­dez al­ways as­sumed that all of this had been done for him as a child. No­body ever men­tioned his im­mi­gra­tion sta­tus at home — less a top­ic of con­ver­sa­tion in those days, par­tic­u­lar­ly for Cu­ban refugees, Mr. Her­nan­dez said. He nev­er thought to ask, he added.</p> <p>Jobs came eas­ily. As a parolee, Mr. Her­nan­dez says, he was given an un­restricted So­cial Se­cu­rity num­ber, which he has had since child­hood. Later, he got a dri­ver’s li­cense.</p> <p>When he en­list­ed in the Army in 1975 as a teen­ager, he said he re­mem­bered, he hand­ed of­fi­cials his pa­role doc­u­ment and tak­ing some kind of oath. That he may not have been an Amer­i­can cit­i­zen crossed his mind then, he said, but the oath he took — a cit­i­zen­ship oath, in his mind — al­layed any doubts.</p> <p>Decades later, wor­ried about his lack of cit­i­zen­ship pa­pers, Mr. Her­nan­dez met with Ms. Ric­ci. Ms. Ric­ci said she was stunned at how long he had lived in lim­bo. She said she was baf­fled why the Bu­reau of Pris­ons had nev­er flagged his lack of cit­i­zen­ship, par­tic­u­lar­ly since Mr. Her­nan­dez did the op­po­site of re­main in the shad­ows.</p> <p>“It’s a clas­sic ex­am­ple of gov­ern­ment in­ef­fi­ciency,” said Ms. Ric­ci, who has taken his case pro bono.</p> <p>Pas­sion­ate about Amer­ica and its priv­i­leges, Mr. Her­nan­dez said he took his cit­i­zen­ship re­spon­si­bil­ities to heart. When Leon Coun­ty elec­tion of­fi­cials here re­cent­ly stripped his name from the voter rolls, “I broke down cry­ing,” he said. He could not even tell a friend about it as they pumped gas.</p> <p>“It was just over­whelm­ing to him,” said Bren­da Sal­vas, the friend and a for­mer col­league. “He said he would call me later on the phone and tell me. That’s the kind of per­son he is. He cares.”</p> </div>",

The square footage of hous­ing trans­ac­tions slumped near­ly 16 per­cent last month, as sell­ers were re­luc­tant to ac­cept the dis­counts that buy­ers in­creas­ing­ly de­mand­ed.</p> <p>Chi­na’s re­al es­tate mar­ket cor­rec­tion — some econ­o­mists are even call­ing it the pop­ping of a bub­ble — is part­ly the re­sult of a de­lib­er­ate de­ci­sion by the coun­try’s lead­ers in Bei­jing.</p> <p>The Fed­eral Re­serve and oth­er reg­u­la­tors in the Unit­ed States did not try to pop the Amer­i­can hous­ing bub­ble in the dec­ade lead­ing up to the mar­ket’s slump in 2008.</p> <p>But the Chi­nese lead­er­ship has been in­creas­ing­ly con­cerned over the past sev­eral years that hous­ing prices were ris­ing to un­afford­able lev­els and that the econ­omy was be­com­ing over­ly de­pend­ent on in­vest­ment, and it has taken ac­tion.</p> <p>The re­sult has been a se­ries of poli­cies that in­cludes pu­ni­tive in­ter­est rates for mort­gages on sec­ond homes, a ban on the pur­chase of third homes and, more re­cent­ly, de­lib­er­ate ac­tion by the cen­tral bank to keep short-term in­ter­est rates well above the rate of in­fla­tion. Zhou Xi­aochuan, the gov­er­nor of the cen­tral bank, the Peo­ple’s Bank of Chi­na, reaf­firmed tight credit poli­cies on Sat­ur­day, say­ing that he did not think the econ­omy was in suf­fi­cient trou­ble to jus­ti­fy mon­e­tary pol­i­cy stim­u­lus.</p> <p>In a coun­try where re­al es­tate sales of­fices have be­come ubiq­ui­tous and tow­er cranes are jok­ing­ly de­scribed as the na­tion­al bird, the ques­tion is how much fur­ther the re­al es­tate mar­ket will slow, and whether its trou­bles will spill in­to oth­er sec­tors of the econ­omy, no­ta­bly the bank­ing sys­tem.</p> <p>In ad­di­tion to de­lay­ing new projects, de­vel­op­ers have sharply re­duced the speed at which they com­plete ex­ist­ing projects, fur­lough­ing work­ers and ship­ping min­i­mal steel to build­ing sites. Eco­nom­ic da­ta re­leased on Tues­day al­so in­cluded a de­cel­er­a­tion in in­dus­trial pro­duc­tion, with growth in steel and ce­ment out­put slow­ing to a crawl. Re­tail sales al­so grew more slow­ly than ex­pect­ed in April, with the fur­ni­ture mar­ket stalling as few­er fam­ilies moved in­to new homes.</p> <p>Su Hua, a re­al es­tate bro­ker in Shen­zhen, had his high­est com­mis­sions ever last year, as a spec­u­la­tive fren­zy prompt­ed fam­ilies all over Chi­na to buy and sell apart­ments at a brisk pace. But he sat in a de­serted of­fice late last week with sev­eral si­lent phones on his desk.</p> <p>His busi­ness has halved so far this year. More wor­ri­some for him is that the dry­ing-up of the mar­ket shows no sign of end­ing.</p> <p>Ac­cord­ing to Cen­taline, one of Chi­na’s larg­est re­al es­tate bro­ker­age firms, trans­ac­tions fell by half in Bei­jing and Shang­hai from a year ago over the May 1 hol­i­day week­end. The week­end is tra­di­tion­al­ly one of the two biggest re­al es­tate buy­ing times of the year, along with a week­long na­tion­al hol­i­day at the start of Oc­to­ber.</p> <p>“There is not much else I know how to do,” Mr. Su said. “Maybe I will con­sid­er sell­ing in­sur­ance on the side, if busi­ness con­tin­ues to slow.”</p> <p>A hand­ful of re­al es­tate re­stric­tions are al­ready be­ing re­scind­ed. State-con­trolled banks in Shen­zhen, ad­ja­cent to Hong Kong, have in the past two weeks stopped charg­ing the ex­tra half per­cent­age point to one per­cent­age point above the reg­u­lat­ed na­tion­al bench­mark rate for mort­gages that they had been col­lect­ing in re­cent years.</p> <p>But some ex­perts ques­tion whether wealthy fam­ilies will want to jump back in­to the re­al es­tate mar­ket even if the most im­por­tant re­stric­tions, on the pur­chase of mul­ti­ple apart­ments, are lift­ed. Nicole Wong, the head of prop­erty re­search at CLSA, a Hong Kong-based bro­ker­age and in­vest­ment firm, said that eas­ing lim­its on over­seas in­vest­ment meant that more wealthy fam­ilies were start­ing to send their mon­ey to Hong Kong and be­yond in­stead of buy­ing ever more apart­ments.</p> <p>For re­al es­tate prices, “even if you re­lax all the re­stric­tions, it won’t make much of a dif­fer­ence,” she said. “The one thing that is cer­tain is the di­rec­tion is set, and it is down — but it can be man­aged.”</p> <p>Chi­nese bank­ing ex­ec­u­tives and econ­o­mists say that a se­vere hous­ing down­turn would most like­ly cause a con­sid­er­able in­crease in non­per­form­ing loans at the coun­try’s banks. But they make sev­eral ar­gu­ments for why even a fair­ly steep slump in hous­ing might not lead to bank fail­ures or emer­gency bailouts of the sort seen in the Unit­ed States when the Amer­i­can hous­ing mar­ket slumped in 2008 and 2009.</p> <p>The top rea­son cited is that even a fair­ly steep drop in the hous­ing mar­ket would still leave the prices of most homes high­er than the bal­ance due on the mort­gages on those homes. So al­most no­body ex­pects a big wave of fore­clo­sures.</p> <p>The bulk of the homes in Chi­na were pur­chased more than five years ago, and re­al es­tate prices have about dou­bled in the past five years. Mort­gage down pay­ments range from 20 per­cent to 40 per­cent and are of­ten high­er, giv­ing banks a larg­er cush­ion against losses.</p> <p>Chi­nese fam­ilies al­so have one of the world’s high­est sav­ing rates — near­ly half of in­come for ur­ban house­holds, com­pared with al­most ze­ro for Amer­i­can house­holds.</p> <p>A big­ger wor­ry, and harder for bank­ing reg­u­la­tors to meas­ure, lies in the ex­tent to which com­pa­nies in oth­er sec­tors have bor­rowed mon­ey from banks and trusts that they were sup­posed to in­vest in equip­ment pur­chases and oth­er busi­ness ac­tiv­i­ties, but have se­cret­ly spec­u­lat­ed in re­al es­tate in­stead.</p> <p>Ex­ten­sive an­ec­dotal ev­i­dence sug­gests that such spec­u­la­tive ac­tiv­ity by com­pa­nies has been very wide­spread. But the losses may on­ly be­come vis­i­ble if there is a deep, sus­tained drop in re­al es­tate prices.</p> <p>Ex­ten­sive gov­ern­ment con­trol over the banks and many busi­ness­es may al­low Bei­jing to slow, but not nec­es­sar­ily re­verse, a slide in the re­al es­tate mar­ket.</p> <p>“You can’t pre­dict how the burst­ing of a Chi­nese re­al es­tate bub­ble plays out be­cause it plays out in very small steps,” said Joel Roth­stein, a part­ner spe­cial­iz­ing in Asian re­al es­tate in the Bei­jing of­fice of the Paul Hast­ings law firm.</p> <p>Oth­er sec­tors of the Chi­nese econ­omy are still health­ier than res­i­den­tial re­al es­tate, and could help sus­tain house­hold in­comes and na­tion­al eco­nom­ic out­put as the prop­erty mar­ket weak­ens. In­fra­struc­ture spend­ing by the gov­ern­ment, par­tic­u­lar­ly rail­road con­struc­tion, is mov­ing in­to high gear. And the cen­tral bank has grad­u­ally pushed down the ren­min­bi against the dol­lar in cur­ren­cy mar­kets this year, help­ing the com­pet­i­tive­ness of Chi­nese goods in for­eign mar­kets.</p> <p>The of­fice and com­mer­cial re­al es­tate sec­tors are tiny in Chi­na com­pared with res­i­den­tial re­al es­tate and have shown wide vari­a­tion among cit­ies. Good lo­ca­tions and high-qual­i­ty build­ings in ma­jor cit­ies like Bei­jing and Shang­hai still at­tract many po­ten­tial buy­ers, but sin­gle floors in of­fice build­ings in many sec­ond- or third-tier cit­ies have fallen out of fa­vor, said James Shep­herd, the ex­ec­u­tive di­rec­tor of greater Chi­na re­search at Cush­man &amp; Wake­field, the glob­al com­mer­cial re­al es­tate bro­ker­age firm.</p> <p>Gov­ern­ment and pri­vate-sec­tor sta­tis­tics for re­al es­tate prices are in­con­sis­tent and hard to com­pare. But dis­counts of 10 per­cent to 20 per­cent from a year ago are in­creas­ing­ly com­mon for homes sold be­tween in­di­vid­u­als, and in­creas­ing­ly for new units sold by de­vel­op­ers as well, re­al es­tate ex­ec­u­tives said.</p> <p>A big­ger ques­tion lies in the po­ten­tial for street protests and oth­er tur­bu­lence if re­al es­tate prices keep falling. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/03/business/international/families-left-vulnerable-in-chinas-housing-market-study-finds.html\">A na­tion­al sur­vey re­leased in March</a> by the South­west­ern Uni­ver­si­ty of Fi­nance and Eco­nom­ics in Cheng­du, Chi­na, found that house­holds across the coun­try have 66 per­cent of their as­sets in their homes, a fig­ure that rises to 84 per­cent in Bei­jing. The com­pa­ra­ble fig­ure for the Unit­ed States, where stocks and bonds are more pop­u­lar, is 41 per­cent.</p> <p>The chair­man of a large de­vel­oper with op­er­a­tions across Chi­na said that of­fer­ing price dis­counts for the re­main­ing units in half-sold projects was ex­treme­ly dif­fi­cult, be­cause ear­lier buy­ers could stage street protests de­mand­ing re­funds equal to the dis­counts.</p> <p>The po­ten­tial for protests, and not bank­ing sec­tor ex­po­sure to re­al es­tate, “is what con­cerns me,” said the de­vel­oper, who in­sist­ed on an­o­nym­ity be­cause of the sen­si­tiv­ity of the is­sue.</p> <p>But Win­nie Y. Cheng, the re­search di­rec­tor at Cen­taline, said that many de­vel­op­ers could not af­ford to hold apart­ments off the mar­ket in­def­i­nite­ly and were al­ready cut­ting prices. Street protests have oc­curred, no­ta­bly in Hang­zhou, but ear­lier buy­ers have most­ly ac­cept­ed the dis­counts for later buy­ers, she said.</p> <p>These days, she added, “All of the de­vel­op­ments are will­ing to cut their price.”</p> </div>",

It is the num­ber of peo­ple per­mit­ted to die in Swedish traf­fic, ac­cord­ing to na­tion­al law.</p> <p>For near­ly two decades, ev­ery ris­ing bar­rier and re­duced speed limit has been tai­lored to this seem­ing­ly im­pos­si­ble goal, of eradi­cat­ing traf­fic deaths and se­ri­ous in­ju­ries, and its guid­ing prem­ise: Ev­ery inch of street space must an­tic­i­pate, and ac­com­mo­date, hu­man er­ror. </p> <p>While road­way deaths have not been elim­i­nat­ed, the coun­try’s rate of fa­tal­i­ties has been whit­tled down to an in­ter­na­tion­al low. Now its ap­proach faces per­haps its stiff­est test: the streets of New York City.</p> <p>In a bid to re­verse gen­er­a­tions of road­way un­rul­i­ness, Mayor Bill de Bla­sio has put the strat­egy, known as Vi­sion Ze­ro, at the fore­front of his trans­porta­tion and po­lic­ing agen­das, tar­get­ing 2024 as the first year with no traf­fic deaths.</p> <p>But in a city of 800 lan­guages, near­ly 14,000 taxis and 8.4 mil­lion po­ten­tial traf­fic rants, street safe­ty promis­es to be a com­pli­cat­ed im­port.</p> <p>Sur­face sim­i­lar­ities be­tween New York and its Eu­ro­pean coun­ter­part, like bike lanes, pe­des­trian is­lands and a well-de­vel­oped tran­sit sys­tem, tend to with­er on clos­er ex­ami­na­tion.</p> <p>Pil­lars of the Swedish model in­clude the re­duc­tion of de­fault speed lim­its and the ex­pan­sion of au­to­mat­ed en­force­ment. Each re­quires the ap­proval of state law­mak­ers in New York, who have yet to em­brace the ideas wide­ly.</p> <p>Round­abouts, a ma­jor traf­fic tool in Swe­den, are dif­fi­cult to imag­ine on the high-den­si­ty streets of Man­hat­tan, trans­porta­tion ex­perts say. The term does not ap­pear in the de Bla­sio ad­min­is­tra­tion’s Vi­sion Ze­ro Ac­tion Plan, re­leased in Feb­ru­ary.</p> <p>In New York, the ad­di­tion of planters and lawn chairs along pe­des­trian plazas drew snick­ers. In Swe­den, pot­ted veg­e­ta­tion is a traf­fic tool, placed on lo­cal roads to slow down dri­vers on straight­aways.</p> <p>In Stock­holm, when the rare car horn sounds, the drone bor­ders on po­lite, more of a gen­tle sug­ges­tion than a throb­bing de­mand. </p> <p>While Swe­den’s pop­u­la­tion — more than 9.5 mil­lion — is on­ly slight­ly larg­er than New York’s, the coun­try has im­posed sweep­ing re­forms in­volv­ing road con­struc­tion, pe­des­trian pro­tec­tions and oth­er poli­cies with rel­a­tive­ly lit­tle con­flict. The Swedish Par­lia­ment adopt­ed Vi­sion Ze­ro in 1997 as the na­tion­al foun­da­tion for all road safe­ty op­er­a­tions, heed­ing the calls of trans­porta­tion plan­ners who warned that the coun­try’s traf­fic strat­egy was ill equipped for the next cen­tu­ry.</p> <p>The re­sult has been a sort of so­cial con­tract be­tween state and cit­i­zen: If res­i­dents fol­low the most ba­sic traf­fic laws, en­gi­neers can de­sign roads to guard against all fa­tal­i­ties.</p> <p>“You should be able to make mis­takes,” said Lars Darin, a sen­ior of­fi­cial with the Swedish Trans­port Ad­min­is­tra­tion, “with­out be­ing pun­ished by death.”</p> <p>Last year, 264 peo­ple were killed, less than half the num­ber in 1997. The fa­tal­i­ty rate in Stock­holm, 1.1 deaths per 100,000, is less than one-third of New York City’s rate. The na­tion­al rate, 2.7 deaths per 100,000, is the low­est in the world, ac­cord­ing to trans­porta­tion of­fi­cials.</p> <p>The Swedish rep­u­ta­tion for pru­dence seems to have seeped in­to the lex­i­con. Those raised in the Vi­sion Ze­ro age use the phrase “typi­cal Swede” as some­thing of a play­ful in­sult.</p> <p>“It’s like you’re too safe, you’re too afraid of ev­ery­thing,” Jo­han­na Brundin, 20, said of the term, as a group of cy­clists swept past her along the city’s Djur­gar­den wa­ter­front. “I like be­ing a Swede.”</p> <p>On many city streets, the speed limit has dipped be­low 20 miles per hour. In sub­ur­ban ar­eas, me­dian bar­ri­ers have pro­lif­er­at­ed, sep­a­rat­ing two-way traf­fic on high-speed cor­ri­dors. </p> <p>Of­fi­cials say the bar­ri­ers and round­abouts have in fact in­creased the po­ten­tial for crash­es, ve­hi­cle dam­age and mi­nor in­ju­ries for some us­ers. The trade-off: The sight of se­ri­ous crash­es at these lo­ca­tions has all but dis­ap­peared. </p> <p>In a de­par­ture from most Amer­i­can traf­fic safe­ty ap­proach­es, in­clud­ing New York City’s, Swedish au­thori­ties have gen­er­ally dis­missed the ef­fects of ed­u­ca­tion or en­force­ment on pe­des­trian safe­ty. They were crit­i­cal of the blitz of jay­walk­ing tick­ets dur­ing Mr. de Bla­sio’s ear­ly months in of­fice and ef­forts by the New York Po­lice De­part­ment to dis­trib­ute cards with safe­ty tips in ar­eas with a re­cent his­to­ry of fa­tal crash­es.</p> <p>“De­sign around the hu­man as we are,” said Claes Tingvall, the di­rec­tor of traf­fic safe­ty at the Swedish Trans­port Ad­min­is­tra­tion and a god­fa­ther of the Vi­sion Ze­ro plan.</p> <p>Though traf­fic deaths have fallen in many ar­eas of the world, in large part be­cause of im­prove­ments in emer­gency care and ve­hi­cle safe­ty, places that have adopt­ed Vi­sion Ze­ro-style pro­grams have re­port­ed dis­pro­por­tion­ate suc­cess. Ac­cord­ing to the New York City plan, fa­tal­i­ty rates in Amer­i­can states with Vi­sion Ze­ro poli­cies, in­clud­ing Min­neso­ta and Utah, fell at a pace more than 25 per­cent quick­er than the na­tion­al rate. </p> <p>In New York, amid a flur­ry of street ad­just­ments un­der Mayor Mi­chael R. Bloomberg, traf­fic deaths have de­creased by about 26 per­cent since 2001. Last year, ac­cord­ing to the city’s Trans­porta­tion De­part­ment, 290 peo­ple were killed. The de­part­ment has been in con­tact with the Swedes, hold­ing phone brief­in­gs with Vi­sion Ze­ro ex­perts and meet­ing in per­son with some who were vis­it­ing New York, though no one from the ad­min­is­tra­tion has trav­eled to Swe­den to look at the strat­egy first­hand.</p> <p>Pol­ly Trot­ten­berg, the city’s trans­porta­tion com­mis­sion­er, em­pha­sized that while her in­ter­na­tion­al peers were a use­ful re­source, New York was “def­i­nite­ly not go­ing to be Stock­holm.”</p> <p>“You want to think care­ful­ly about cul­ture change,” Ms. Trot­ten­berg said. “New York City is one of the more re­mark­able pe­des­trian cul­tures in the world.”</p> <p>The city’s plan has called for im­proved precinct-level po­lice en­force­ment of speed­ing rules, the widen­ing of park­ing lanes and the place­ment of “black box” da­ta recorders in taxi­cabs. Mr. Tingvall of the Swedish Trans­port Ad­min­is­tra­tion called the set of pro­pos­als “very im­pres­sive.” </p> <p>In re­cent weeks, the city has al­so un­veiled a se­ries of “ar­te­rial slow zones,” re­duc­ing the speed limit to 25 m.p.h. from 30 in des­ig­nated ar­eas, among oth­er changes.</p> <p>Street over­hauls that pro­voked sig­nif­i­cant com­mu­nity tur­moil un­der Mr. Bloomberg, like the ex­pan­sion of bike lanes, ap­pear less po­lit­i­cal­ly di­vi­sive when framed in the con­text of pub­lic safe­ty.</p> <p>At the city’s urg­ing, state law­mak­ers re­cent­ly ap­proved the ad­di­tion of 120 speed cam­eras in New York City school zones, bring­ing the to­tal to 140. Swe­den has more than 1,100.</p> <p>Swe­den has al­so in­stalled a con­ges­tion-based toll plan, sim­i­lar to the one cham­pi­oned un­suc­cess­ful­ly by Mr. Bloomberg, that has re­duced traf­fic vol­umes by 20 per­cent in the tar­get ar­eas. Its safe­ty ef­fects are twofold, of­fi­cials say: bet­ter cy­cling and walk­ing con­di­tions, with few­er cars on the road, and in­creased rev­enues to pay for ma­jor road im­prove­ments.</p> <p>At least some Swedish vig­i­lance seems to pre­date Vi­sion Ze­ro. </p> <p>About 20 years ago, a now-de­funct pro­gram al­lowed some home­own­ers to de­cide where speed bumps would be in­stalled. The re­sult: a hump ev­ery 20 me­ters in some neigh­bor­hoods, and some very slow trips home.</p> <p>A vet­eran taxi dri­ver, Nabil Bel­lar, 42, said he had nev­er been asked to speed up.</p> <p>“They say, ‘I have time, you don’t need to stress,’ ” he said of his typi­cal pas­sen­ger, as he wait­ed out­side Stock­holm Cen­tral Sta­tion.</p> <p>Oth­ers ap­pre­ci­ate the coun­try’s zeal for traf­fic safe­ty on­ly in hind­sight. In 1998, Mr. Tingvall said, a dri­ver who had sur­vived af­ter crash­ing in­to a new­ly con­struct­ed bar­rier sent the trans­port ad­min­is­tra­tion a cake.</p> <p>For Nick­las Carl­son, 32, an an­thro­pol­ogy stu­dent at Stock­holm Uni­ver­si­ty, clar­ity ar­rived as he sat in the back seat of a New York taxi in 2009, af­ter his cab­by left the ve­hi­cle to shout at a ri­val on the road. </p> <p>“In broad day­light!” Mr. Carl­son mar­veled. “This would nev­er, ever hap­pen in Swe­den.”</p> </div>",

The sen­tence matched the pros­e­cu­tors’ re­quest; Mr. Olmert’s lawyers had asked that he be re­quired on­ly to do com­mu­nity serv­ice.</p> <p>Judge Da­vid Rozen of Tel Aviv Dis­trict Court said that Mr. Olmert and the nine gov­ern­ment of­fi­cials and busi­ness fig­ures con­vict­ed along­side him had all “harmed the pub­lic trust,” and that the for­mer prime min­is­ter de­served a harsh sen­tence be­cause he is a pub­lic fig­ure and a clever man.</p> <p>“The can­cer must be up­root­ed,” Judge Rozen said, re­fer­ring to po­lit­i­cal cor­rup­tion. An­shel Pf­ef­fer, a vet­eran colum­nist, said on Twit­ter that the judge was in­dict­ing a whole class of “Is­rael’s fi­nan­cial and po­lit­i­cal elite.”</p> <p>In a case that an­a­lysts here said vin­di­cat­ed pros­e­cu­tors whose cam­paigns against cor­rup­tion had been crit­i­cized as over­zeal­ous and ex­pen­sive, Mr. Olmert was found guilty six weeks af­ter a sweep­ing, years­long in­ves­ti­ga­tion in­to the plan­ning process sur­round­ing the hulk­ing, hat­ed apart­ment com­plex in south­ern Je­ru­sa­lem known as Holy­land. A judge in 2010 called it “one of the worst cor­rup­tion af­fairs in Is­raeli his­to­ry.”</p> <p>Mr. Olmert, who is 68 and was prime min­is­ter from 2006 to 2009, re­leased a state­ment be­fore the 9 a.m. court ses­sion say­ing that Tues­day was “a sad day, on which a se­vere and un­just ver­dict is to be hand­ed down to an in­no­cent man.” He ar­rived at court wear­ing cas­ual kha­ki slacks and a roy­al-blue but­ton-down shirt with a pen in the pock­et.</p> <p>At a sen­tenc­ing hear­ing last month, Mr. Olmert said that the guilty ver­dict had “com­plete­ly stunned” him and was “based on a fun­da­men­tal er­ror.”</p> <p>“I nev­er asked for and nev­er re­ceived a bribe, nei­ther di­rect­ly nor in­di­rect­ly, for my­self, my as­so­ciates or my fam­ily,” Mr. Olmert, who served as Je­ru­sa­lem’s mayor from 1993 to 2003, told Judge Rozen then. “Nat­u­ral­ly, the right way for me to ap­peal the court’s de­ci­sion is to ap­peal to the Su­preme Court,” he added. “I be­lieve the Su­preme Court will make the ef­fort to see the whole pic­ture — that I nev­er got a bribe from any­one. That is the truth.”</p> <p>But Judge Rozen, in is­su­ing a sear­ing 700-page ver­dict on March 31, said that Mr. Olmert “told lies in court” and that his ver­sion of events “has been re­ject­ed by me in ev­ery way.” The judge found that half a mil­lion shekels — about $144,000 to­day — had been fun­neled in a se­ries of post­dat­ed checks from a fi­nan­cier hired to ease Holy­land’s path through the city plan­ning process to Mr. Olmert’s broth­er, Yos­si.</p> <p>Mr. Olmert was or­dered Tues­day to pay resti­tu­tion plus a fine of near­ly $300,000.</p> <p>“Olmert got huge sums and it does not mat­ter if it went to his broth­er or his pock­et,” Judge Rozen said Tues­day. “The time that has passed since the crimes is not a rea­son for le­niency.”</p> <p>He said “the deeds of the con­vict­ed un­der­mine the trust of the pub­lic in their lead­ers” and said that they would start their prison terms on Sept. 1.</p> <p>“The tak­er of bribes dis­gusts us, with his pow­er to make the in­sti­tu­tions of the state hate­ful to the pub­lic,” the judge added. “The tak­er of bribes smash­es the foun­da­tion stone of his work and be­trays the trust given him.”</p> <p>Holy­land, a se­ries of in­ter­lock­ing lux­u­ry apart­ment build­ings that dom­i­nates the view for miles, swelled to more than 12 times the height grant­ed in the orig­i­nal per­mits. Some Je­ru­sa­lem res­i­dents call it “the mon­ster.” Seven of the nine peo­ple con­vict­ed in the case were sen­tenced along­side Mr. Olmert on Tues­day, with prison terms from three to seven years; Holy­land’s de­vel­oper, Hil­lel Char­ney, is to serve three and a half years and pay a fine of more than $500,000.</p> <p>Mr. Olmert was al­so con­vict­ed of breach of trust in a sep­a­rate case in 2012, and was ques­tioned by the po­lice re­cent­ly re­gard­ing ob­struc­tion of jus­tice re­lated to Holy­land.</p> <p>Mr. Olmert start­ed his ca­reer in the right-wing Likud Par­ty, but left to help cre­ate the cen­trist Kadi­ma Par­ty in 2005, tak­ing over as prime min­is­ter af­ter Ar­iel Sharon suf­fered a de­bil­i­tat­ing stroke the next year. Mr. Olmert led a war in Leb­a­non in 2006 that has been a stain on the Is­raeli mil­i­tary’s his­to­ry, and was be­lieved to be on the brink of a peace deal with the Pales­tini­ans when he was forced from of­fice un­der a cloud of cor­rup­tion in­ves­ti­ga­tions.</p> <p>Un­til his March con­vic­tion, he had been plot­ting a pos­si­ble po­lit­i­cal come­back, some­thing that seems all but im­pos­si­ble now. Judge Rozen’s de­ter­mi­na­tion that his crimes were taint­ed by “moral turpi­tude” pre­vents him from run­ning for pub­lic of­fice for seven years.</p> </div>",

That’s him on the oth­er side of the di­a­mond, next to the short­stop.</p> <p>Some base­ball po­si­tions as they have long been known are chang­ing be­fore our eyes. The cause is the in­field shift, a phe­nom­enon ex­plod­ing this year as more teams are us­ing sta­tis­ti­cal anal­y­sis and em­brac­ing a dy­namic ap­proach to pre­vi­ous­ly sta­t­ic de­fens­es.</p> <p>Now, armed with ev­i­dence that shows how a bat­ter has a propen­si­ty to hit the ball to cer­tain parts of the field, teams will po­si­tion their in­field­ers ac­cord­ing­ly — at times tak­ing them far from their tra­di­tion­al spots.</p> <p>“The shift is on the verge of be­com­ing the norm,” said Joe Mad­don, the man­ager of the Tam­pa Bay Rays and one of the ear­ly lead­ing pro­po­nents of the shift. “When you’re not shift­ing now is al­most go­ing to be the anom­aly de­fense.”</p> <p>From 2010 to 2013, in­field shifts stead­ily in­creased, ac­cord­ing to re­search by Base­ball In­fo So­lu­tions, which tracks ev­ery shift and the num­ber of runs it saves. But from 2013 to this sea­son, the rate of shift­ing in the ma­jor leagues has mush­roomed.</p> <p>Last year there were 8,134 shifts on balls in play. Through the week­end, teams had al­ready shift­ed 3,213 times, putting them on pace for near­ly 14,000 for the sea­son. Teams that shift reg­u­lar­ly are low­er­ing op­pos­ing teams’ bat­ting av­er­ages by 30 to 40 points on grounders and low line dri­ves.</p> <p>“You do it be­cause it works,” said Mark Tei­xeira, the Yan­kees first base­man. As a bat­ter, he has been a vic­tim of the shift for the past few years, per­haps ex­plain­ing, in part, why his bat­ting av­er­age went from .290 over his first four years in base­ball to .249 since 2010, when teams be­gan shift­ing on him reg­u­lar­ly.</p> <p>Ben Jedlovec is the sen­ior vice pres­i­dent for prod­uct de­vel­op­ment and sales at Base­ball In­fo So­lu­tions, a com­pa­ny that was start­ed by John De­wan, the au­thor of the book “The Field­ing Bi­ble.” The com­pa­ny tracks ev­ery pitch and ev­ery play and pro­vides soft­ware and tools to about two-thirds of ma­jor league teams.</p> <p>“There’s no end in sight,” Jedlovec said about teams’ will­ing­ness to em­ploy the shift.</p> <p>At first, the nat­u­ral tar­gets of the shift were slug­gers like Da­vid Or­tiz, Jim Thome, Adam Dunn and Ryan How­ard — all big left-hand­ed hit­ters who reg­u­lar­ly pull the ball to the right. Now, with sta­tis­ti­cal anal­y­sis in­flu­enc­ing more man­ag­ers’ de­ci­sions, even light­ly re­gard­ed hit­ters like Kelly John­son of the Yan­kees might see field­ers shift­ing against them, and more right-hand­ed hit­ters are see­ing the shift as well.</p> <p>“Base­ball isn’t big on change,” said De­wan, who be­gan ad­vo­cat­ing de­fen­sive shifts about 10 years ago. “But once oth­er man­ag­ers and teams saw the Rays do­ing it suc­cess­ful­ly, per­haps they didn’t feel as if they were go­ing out on a limb so much, and wouldn’t be crit­i­cized when some­one hap­pens to get a hit against the shift.”</p> <p>Fol­low­ing the Rays, the Hous­ton As­tros have em­braced the shift with zeal, from the depths of their mi­nor leagues up to the ma­jors. As of the week­end they had em­ployed 368 shifts, more than one per in­ning and far more than any oth­er team, even the Rays.</p> <p>“It’s an epiph­any,” Mad­don said. “I much pre­ferred it when all the oth­er teams didn’t want to do those things.”</p> <p>The As­tros be­gan em­ploy­ing the shift ear­ly last year. But the pitch­ers ob­ject­ed, say­ing they did not feel com­fort­able with a de­fense over­loaded to one side of the in­field and a gap­ing hole on the oth­er. The As­tros’ man­age­ment backed off, but it did not give up.</p> <p>In spring train­ing, the As­tros’ gen­er­al man­ager, Jeff Luh­now, and his coach­ing staff came armed with da­ta, pre­sented it to the pitch­ers and dis­cussed why they want­ed to em­brace the shift. That anal­y­sis in­cluded a look at the im­proved de­fense of the Pitts­burgh Pi­rates over the pre­vi­ous two sea­sons.</p> <p>The Pi­rates had most­ly the same in­field­ers those two years, and in 2012 they turned 339 dou­ble plays, 13th in the Na­tion­al League. But in 2013, with the shift, they turned 419, the fourth most in the league. Their pitch­ers’ earned run av­er­age dropped to 3.26 from 3.86.</p> <p>The As­tros pitch­ers were per­suad­ed, and Base­ball In­fo So­lu­tions es­ti­mated the shift had saved them 11 runs so far this year. Hous­ton now us­es the shift all the way down to its Class A club. “We’re con­fi­dent that it’s helped us get more outs than we would have with­out it,” Luh­now said.</p> <p>The Yan­kees are sec­ond to the As­tros with 223 de­fen­sive shifts in 2014. They were al­ready stead­ily in­creas­ing their shifts over the past few sea­sons, but dur­ing the off-sea­son their quan­ti­ta­tive anal­y­sis de­part­ment, head­ed by Da­vid Gra­bin­er and Mi­chael Fish­man, was as­signed to the mat­ter.</p> <p>They even­tu­al­ly pro­posed a com­pre­hen­sive plan that now has play­ers in the ma­jors and the mi­nors shift­ing like nev­er be­fore.</p> <p>But as much as the shift is blos­som­ing this year, it is hard­ly a new phe­nom­enon. There is ev­i­dence of the shift go­ing back more than 130 years. Art­work sug­gests that be­fore the 1880s, base­men would stand on top of the bases. Ac­cord­ing to Tom Shieber, a his­to­rian at the Base­ball Hall of Fame, that was be­cause of dif­fer­ent foul-ball rules that made first and third base­men re­spon­si­ble for greater swaths of foul ter­ri­to­ry.</p> <p>Once those rules changed in the mid-1880s, play­ers took up the now fa­mil­iar po­si­tions. But even back then, there were in­no­va­tors. Shieber said that one of his col­leagues at the Hall of Fame, Bill Fran­cis, re­cent­ly dis­cov­ered ev­i­dence of an in­field shift in a June 25, 1870, ac­count in The New York Clip­per of a game be­tween the At­lantics of Brook­lyn and the Cin­cin­nati Red Stock­ings.</p> <p>“The Cin­cin­nati field­ers moved about in the field, ac­cord­ing as the dif­fer­ent bats­men came to bat,” the Clip­per story said, not­ing that it was in­no­va­tive.</p> <p>The most fa­mous shift of the 20th cen­tu­ry was used by Cleve­land In­di­ans Man­ager Lou Boudreau against Ted Williams, the Boston Red Sox left-hand­ed slug­ger, in Ju­ly 1946, al­though there are ac­counts of a shift against Williams dat­ing to 1941.</p> <p>An ear­lier Williams, Cy, was a vic­tim of the shift in the 1920s, and in Ja­pan teams used the Oh-Shif­tu against Sada­haru Oh in 1964.</p> <p>In his mem­oir, Boudreau said the shift was about not on­ly de­fense but al­so the bat­ter’s psy­chol­ogy. Mad­don agreed.</p> <p>“You are try­ing to split some­one’s de­sires, his con­cen­tra­tion, his thoughts,” Mad­don said. “It’s a psy­cho­log­i­cal ploy as well. They grew up look­ing out from the bat­ter’s box and the in­field had a cer­tain look to it. Now when you look out there, peo­ple are in dif­fer­ent places. How’s that go­ing to af­fect you in that at-bat?”</p> <p>What are the risks of shift­ing? “None,” Mad­don said.</p> <p>Some might dis­agree. Last year at Fen­way Park, Robin­son Cano bunt­ed to­ward an emp­ty third base against a Boston Red Sox shift and end­ed up with a dou­ble. But Mad­don point­ed out that if Cano or any oth­er dan­ger­ous hit­ter pre­ferred to bunt, that was O.K. with him. Bet­ter a bunt than a home run.</p> <p>De­wan, the head of Base­ball In­fo So­lu­tions, said his com­pa­ny did not rec­om­mend shift­ing in the out­field be­cause the da­ta sug­gest­ed that even pull hit­ters tend­ed to hit the ball in the air to the out­field ei­ther straight away or even to the op­po­site field rough­ly 54 per­cent of the time. And the risks can be too great. A ball that lands against a shift­ed out­field could con­ceiv­ably go for an in­side-the-park home run by the time any­one runs it down.</p> <p>De­wan al­so did not rec­om­mend shift­ing the in­field too of­ten with men on base be­cause it could leave field­ers out of po­si­tion to cov­er bases. In a re­cent game at An­gels Sta­dium, the Yan­kees could not cov­er first base on a bunt be­cause the sec­ond base­man was shift­ed too far up the mid­dle.</p> <p>Luh­now, the As­tros’ gen­er­al man­ager, said that as teams saw more of the shift, they might dis­cov­er ways to beat it. Bob­by Val­en­tine agrees. When he man­aged the Mets in 1999, he had his in­fielder run to set po­si­tions as the pitch­er was de­liv­er­ing. He said that could be put in­to use by teams who want to dis­guise their de­fense un­til the last mo­ment, much like a foot­ball team hid­ing its blitz.</p> <p>“Some­one will come up with some­thing new,” Val­en­tine said. “It will prob­a­bly be Joe Mad­don.”</p> </div>",

The move by the pros­ecu­tor, Ger­rie Nel, could have a sig­nif­i­cant ef­fect on both the du­ra­tion of the tri­al, ini­tial­ly set to last three weeks, and on the ba­sis for a judg­ment, South Af­ri­can le­gal an­a­lysts said.</p> <p>Mr. Pis­to­rius, 27, a dou­ble-am­pu­tee track star whose glit­ter­ing ath­let­ic ca­reer has taken him to the Olympic and Par­a­lympic Games, is ac­cused of mur­der­ing his girl­friend, Ree­va Steenkamp, 29, in the ear­ly hours of Feb. 14, 2013. He de­nied the charge — which car­ries a mini­mum 25-year jail term — say­ing that he shot Ms. Steenkamp by mis­take, think­ing that an in­truder had en­tered his home in Pre­toria.</p> <p>The ques­tion of a psy­chi­at­ric ex­ami­na­tion emerged for the first time on Mon­day when Mer­ryll Vorster, a fo­ren­sic psy­chi­a­trist tes­ti­fy­ing for the de­fense, said that Mr. Pis­to­rius suf­fered from gen­er­al anxi­ety dis­order, dat­ing to the am­pu­ta­tion of both legs be­low the knee at the age of 11 months af­ter he was born with­out fibu­la bones.</p> <p>The psy­chi­a­trist al­so de­scribed a trou­bled child­hood dom­i­nat­ed by a largely ab­sent fa­ther and a moth­er so given to anxi­ety about po­ten­tial in­trud­ers that she slept with a fire­arm un­der her pil­low. The tri­al is be­ing held in Pre­toria and is be­ing broad­cast around the world.</p> <p>In ar­gu­ments on Tues­day, Bar­ry Roux, Mr. Pis­to­rius’s lead de­fense law­yer, said his cli­ent’s con­di­tion was “not a men­tal ill­ness” in terms of crim­i­nal pro­cedure. Ms. Vorster said her di­ag­no­sis did not ren­der him un­fit to stand tri­al.</p> <p>But Mr. Nel said that there had been ev­i­dence that Mr. Pis­to­rius’s dis­order “may have played a role” and an ex­ami­na­tion could es­tab­lish whether the ath­lete was men­tal­ly ill.</p> <p>“We could get to an ap­peal court where ques­tions would be asked why noth­ing was done about the psy­cho­log­i­cal di­ag­no­sis,” Mr. Nel said, ar­gu­ing al­so that there had been no ear­lier al­lu­sions in the tri­al by the de­fense to psy­cho­log­i­cal fac­tors as a pos­si­ble ex­pla­na­tion for Mr. Pis­to­rius’s ac­tions.</p> <p>Mr. Roux said Mr. Nel’s read­ing of law re­ports con­cern­ing oth­er cases was “rather un­for­tu­nate” and called the pros­ecu­tor’s ar­gu­ment “man­i­fest­ly ab­surd.” He de­scribed Mr. Nel’s ar­gu­ment as a “ruse.”</p> <p>Judge Thokozile Ma­tilda Masi­pa ad­journed the ses­sion and said she would rule on the dis­pute on Wednes­day.</p> </div>",

Both sides are backed by armed forces locked in an un­easy stand­off that has led to clash­es and blood­shed.</p> <p>Rus­sia, the key pow­er bro­ker in the re­gion, stopped short of out­right rec­og­ni­tion of the dri­ve for se­ces­sion, us­ing the re­sults to press for a ne­go­ti­ated au­ton­omy for those provinces.</p> <p>In a state­ment on Mon­day, the Krem­lin said on­ly that it “re­spects the will of the pop­u­la­tion of the Donet­sk and Luhan­sk re­gions,” and that the cri­sis should be re­solved through di­a­logue.</p> <p>De­spite those words, Moscow kept up pres­sure on the in­terim au­thori­ties in Kiev through Gazprom, the gi­ant nat­u­ral gas com­pa­ny in which the Russ­ian gov­ern­ment has a 50.01 per­cent stake. The Krem­lin of­ten us­es Gazprom for po­lit­i­cal pur­poses.</p> <p>A spokes­man for Gazprom, Sergei Kupriyanov, said in a state­ment on Tues­day that the Ukrain­ian state gas com­pa­ny, Naftogaz, would have un­til June 2 to pay $1.6 bil­lion for June gas sup­plies, news re­ports said. “Start­ing from June 3,” the state­ment said, seem­ing to threaten a cut­off if the pay­ment is not made, “the com­pa­ny will re­ceive gas for Ukrain­ian con­sumers on­ly in the amounts it has paid for.”</p> <p>Naftogaz said that it had been no­ti­fied of the ad­vance pay­ment de­mand, but de­clined fur­ther com­ment.</p> <p>Mr. Stein­meier met the act­ing prime min­is­ter of Ukraine, Ar­seniy P. Yat­senyuk, in Kiev and had plans to travel on to Odessa on the Black Sea, where a fire killed some 40 peo­ple ear­lier this month, Ger­man diplo­mats said.</p> <p>“We sup­port your ef­forts to launch a na­tion­al di­a­logue, un­der Ukrain­ian own­er­ship, here in your coun­try, through round ta­bles, at the cen­tral level and in the re­gions,” Mr. Stein­meier told a joint news con­fer­ence with Mr. Yat­senyuk, news re­ports said.</p> <p>“I hope this will cre­ate the con­di­tions to take a step to bring back oc­cu­pied ter­ri­to­ry, dis­arm armed groups step-by-step and re­install the au­thor­ity of the state,” Mr. Stein­meier said, add­ing that the planned pres­i­den­tial elec­tions on May 25 would “play a cru­cial role” in end­ing a cri­sis that ranks as one of the most se­ri­ous in Eu­rope since the end of the Cold War.</p> <p>Mr. Yat­senyuk was sched­uled to meet later in the day with of­fi­cials of the Eu­ro­pean Un­ion in Brus­sels.</p> <p>The trip was Mr. Stein­meier’s third to the coun­try since Feb­ru­ary, when he and his French and Pol­ish coun­ter­parts bro­kered an ac­cord be­tween demon­stra­tors and Pres­i­dent Vik­tor F. Yanukovych that fell apart when Mr. Yanukovych was ousted and fled the coun­try for south­ern Rus­sia.</p> <p>Ger­many has re­peat­ed­ly pushed for a diplo­mat­ic so­lu­tion in Ukraine while in­sist­ing that it would sup­port tougher sanc­tions if Rus­sia ei­ther in­vades or ob­structs the sched­uled pres­i­den­tial vote on May 25. Above all, Ger­man politi­cians have made clear, they seek an elect­ed fig­ure to deal with in Kiev.</p> <p>Mr. Stein­meier is al­so pro­mot­ing a pro­posal to get the Or­ga­ni­za­tion for Se­cu­rity and Co­oper­a­tion in Eu­rope, a 57-na­tion group that in­cludes Eu­rope and the Unit­ed States as well as Ukraine and Rus­sia, in­volved in dis­arm­ing sep­a­ratists, pro­mot­ing di­a­logue and over­see­ing a free and fair elec­tion.</p> <p>Pres­i­dent Vladimir V. Putin of Rus­sia has as­sured his sup­port, though Rus­sia has al­so pledged to re­spect the ref­er­en­dums in east­ern Ukraine that were con­demned as il­le­gal by the au­thori­ties in Kiev and by the West.</p> <p>Berlin has asked the vet­eran Ger­man dip­lo­mat Wolf­gang Ischinger, a for­mer am­bas­sa­dor to the Unit­ed States who now runs an an­nual se­cu­rity con­fer­ence held in Mu­nich each Feb­ru­ary, to co­ordi­nate a se­ries of “round ta­bles” in­tend­ed to bring to­gether all sec­tions of Ukrain­ian so­ci­ety un­der the O.S.C.E. pro­posal.</p> <p>The ter­mi­nol­o­gy be­ing used harks back to 1989, when Po­land’s Com­mu­nist rulers met rep­re­sen­ta­tives of the trade un­ion Sol­i­dar­ity, and to the time when the Com­mu­nists who ruled East Ger­many, where Chan­cel­lor An­gela Merkel grew up, met dis­si­dents. But Ger­man me­dia ques­tioned whether there is in Ukraine to­day even that mini­mum of na­tion­al con­sen­sus that ex­ist­ed in So­viet bloc coun­tries then.</p> <p>“For such talks to be suc­cess­ful, min­i­mal con­sen­sus is re­quired,” not­ed Dan­iel Brössler in the Süd­deutsche Zeitung. “All sides must con­sid­er a com­pro­mise at least con­ceiv­able. And that’s the ques­tion: Who should, or could, con­clude what kind of com­pro­mise?”</p> <p>Eu­ro­peans fa­vor the O.S.C.E. as the best ve­hi­cle for ne­go­ti­a­tions since it in­cludes all the coun­tries in­volved in the cri­sis and hap­pens cur­rent­ly to be chaired by Switz­er­land. In ad­di­tion, the or­ga­ni­za­tion has man­dates to do what Mr. Stein­meier and oth­ers have ad­vo­cated for both sides in Ukraine — to dis­arm, fos­ter di­a­logue and ob­serve elec­tions.</p> <p>Rus­sia has of­ten viewed the group fa­vor­ably too, in part be­cause it grew out of an ac­cord in 1975 that the So­vi­ets felt put them on a par with the West for the first time dur­ing the Cold War.</p> </div>",

In front of him were com­puter screens and a video dis­play con­nect­ing him to Mau­na Kea, home of the <a href=\"http://www.keckobservatory.org/\">twin Keck tele­scopes</a>, at 40 feet in di­am­e­ter the two larg­est in the world. </p> <p>He clicked an icon on one of his screens. Three thou­sand miles west and 14,000 feet up, a glass con­tain­er about the shape and size of a tu­na can slid in­to place in the beam of the Keck I tele­scope, in­ter­pos­ing a cal­i­brat­ing layer of io­dine gas be­tween it and the stars. </p> <p>That was far­ther away, he not­ed, than the <a href=\"http://hubblesite.org/\">Hub­ble Space Tele­scope</a>.</p> <p>Queued up for ob­ser­va­tion from Mau­na Kea that night were a few dozen of the most prom­is­ing ob­jects yet found by NASA’s vaunt­ed planet-hunt­ing Kep­ler space­craft.</p> <p>“These are earths,” Dr. Mar­cy said, ges­tur­ing to the screens. “All my life I’ve point­ed tele­scopes at stars not know­ing if plan­ets were there or not. Now we know.”</p> <p>He paused.</p> <p>Hu­man­ity, he said, had ar­rived at a spe­cial but bit­ter­sweet mo­ment.</p> <p>For thou­sands of years, peo­ple had looked up at the night sky won­der­ing whether they were alone in these star­ry depths, whether there was any place like Earth out there, and how they would ever know. On­ly 20 years ago, the no­tion of oth­er worlds and oth­er life was dis­missed as sci­ence fic­tion in re­spect­able ac­a­demic cir­cles. Now as­tronomers have ev­i­dence that there are more plan­ets than stars out there, a bil­lion chances for Dar­win, a bil­lion po­ten­tial re­al es­tate deals, a bil­lion sci-fi dreams come true — a sig­na­ture shift in cos­mic per­spec­tive, in which Dr. Mar­cy played a lead­ing role. </p> <p>He and his col­leagues were on the verge of be­ing able to say how com­mon Earth­like worlds were in the gal­axy.</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy was be­ing men­tioned as a con­tender for the No­bel Prize.</p> <p>But Kep­ler had <a title=\"Times article, Nov. 18, 2013.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/science/space/new-plan-for-a-disabled-kepler.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry529%23%2FKepler\">bro­ken down</a> af­ter four years of planet-hunt­ing glo­ry, and plans had col­lapsed for a grand, much-pro­mot­ed space mis­sion known as the <a title=\"NASA missions page.\" href=\"http://science.nasa.gov/missions/tpf/\">Ter­res­trial Planet Finder</a>, which could produce im­ages of dis­tant plan­ets, sniff their at­mos­pheres and per­haps map their ge­og­ra­phy to de­ter­mine whether they were hab­it­able or in­hab­it­ed.</p> <p>The field, he feared, was ap­proach­ing a lull.</p> <p>“What are we go­ing to do when we’ve squeezed the last drop from Kep­ler?” Dr. Mar­cy asked. “A side of me is al­ready griev­ing.”</p> <p><strong>Cos­mic Dreams</strong></p> <p>The road to the math build­ing base­ment had been bumpy and long, and Dr. Mar­cy had the emo­tion­al bruises to show for it. He was born 59 years ago in St. Clair Shores, Mich., and had what he called a “plain va­nilla” up­bring­ing in the San Fer­nan­do Val­ley, im­bued with a love of sports and space. Carl Sa­gan, the Cor­nell as­tron­o­mer, best-sell­ing au­thor and host of the PBS se­ries “Cos­mos,” was his hero.</p> <p>He at­tend­ed U.C.L.A. and then the Uni­ver­si­ty of Cal­i­for­nia, San­ta Cruz, where he earned a Ph.D. us­ing spec­tro­scop­ic mea­sure­ments to study mag­net­ic fields in stars.</p> <p>But the star­ry road al­most end­ed short­ly af­ter that. Dr. Mar­cy won a pres­ti­gious post­doc­tor­al fel­low­ship to con­tinue his mag­net­ic re­search at the <a href=\"http://www.mtwilson.edu/\">Mount Wil­son Ob­ser­va­tory</a> in Pas­a­dena, Calif., where he would be us­ing the same tele­scope with which <a title=\"Britannica.com article.\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/274489/Edwin-Powell-Hubble\">Ed­win Hub­ble</a> had dis­cov­ered the ex­pan­sion of the uni­verse in 1929. </p> <p>But Dr. Mar­cy’s mea­sure­ments didn’t work and his pre­vi­ous re­sults came un­der fire from oth­er as­tronomers. “I got re­al­ly ham­mered in Pas­a­dena,” he re­called. </p> <p>He was dev­as­tated. He felt stu­pid and ill judged. “I was so ob­vi­ous­ly a fraud,” he re­called think­ing. He con­sult­ed a psy­chi­a­trist.</p> <p>He won­dered if he was sui­cidal. Then he won­dered how he would know. </p> <p>A turn­ing point, he said, came while he was in the show­er one morn­ing in 1983, con­tem­plat­ing the end of his as­tron­omy ca­reer. He de­cid­ed that if he was go­ing down in flames, he would go down do­ing some­thing he be­lieved in. He vowed to spend the rest of his ca­reer hunt­ing for life in the uni­verse. That meant search­ing for plan­ets around oth­er stars.</p> <p>“You need plan­ets,” he said. “That stands at the nexus. The log­i­cal plat­form for life is a planet.”</p> <p>By the time he got out of the show­er, his fin­gers were all wrin­kled. </p> <p>“I’ve nev­er for­got­ten how mis­er­able I was in that show­er,” Dr. Mar­cy said. </p> <p><strong>A Fire in the Bel­ly</strong></p> <p>When his fel­low­ship was up in 1983, Dr. Mar­cy took a job teach­ing at San Fran­cis­co State Uni­ver­si­ty, far from the re­search lime­light — it had no Ph.D. pro­gram. In his spare time, be­tween teach­ing and fix­ing the tele­scope on the roof of the sci­ence build­ing, he as­sem­bled a team of stu­dents to work on how to find plan­ets around oth­er stars — if they were out there. </p> <p>One of his stu­dents was <a title=\"Times obituary, Nov. 7, 1996.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/07/us/mario-savio-53-campus-protester-dies.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry199%23%2FMario+Savio\">Mario Savio</a>, for­mer­ly the fire­brand leader of the Free Speech Move­ment in Berke­ley in the ’60s. In his of­fice, Dr. Mar­cy keeps a pic­ture of Mr. Savio, who went on to teach physics at So­noma State and died in 1996, at 53. He was bril­liant, Dr. Mar­cy re­called, but “he hat­ed writ­ing com­puter code.”</p> <p>A big break came when a grad­u­ate stu­dent, R. Paul But­ler, who had just re­ceived an un­der­grad­u­ate chem­istry de­gree, showed up in his of­fice in the fall of 1986.</p> <p>A recipe for find­ing plan­ets had been laid out by the em­i­nent as­tron­o­mer <a title=\"Times obituary, April 8, 1963.\" href=\"http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B13FD3858137A93CBA9178FD85F478685F9&amp;action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Aw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%23%2FOtto%2BStruve%2F\">Ot­to Struve</a> in 1952. He point­ed out that a planet would give its home star a small grav­i­ta­tion­al kick, in­duc­ing a wob­ble in­to the star’s mo­tion as seen from Earth. In prin­ci­ple this could be de­tect­ed by slight shifts in the wave­lengths of light from the star, like the <a title=\"Britannica.com description.\" href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/169328/Doppler-effect\">Dopp­ler shift</a> that causes the pitch of an am­bu­lance si­ren to change as it goes past. But it re­quired a spec­tro­graph that could de­tect the shifts of one part in 10 mil­lion to see some­thing like Ju­pi­ter. </p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy’s new grad­u­ate stu­dent had “fire in his bel­ly,” he re­called, and he put him to work find­ing a way to make a spec­tro­graph sen­si­tive enough to do the job. At Mount Wil­son, Dr. Mar­cy al­ready knew, so­lar as­tronomers cal­i­brated their spec­tro­graphs by pass­ing sun­light through io­dine, which ab­sorbs light at par­tic­u­lar wave­lengths, pro­ducing dark lines like the gaps in a pick­et fence that can serve as ref­er­ence points. </p> <p>Af­ter con­sid­er­ing oth­er ideas, he and Mr. But­ler set­tled on io­dine to cal­i­brate their own ma­chine. Mr. But­ler built a cell to hold io­dine, and in 1987 they in­stalled it on the Shane three-me­ter tele­scope at the uni­ver­si­ty’s <a href=\"http://mthamilton.ucolick.org/\">Lick Ob­ser­va­tory</a>, out­side San Jose, and be­gan look­ing at stars.</p> <p>It took them eight years to re­fine their tech­niques to find a planet. Wave­length shifts could be eas­ily blurred, for ex­am­ple, by changes in the at­mos­phere from night to night or even mo­ment to mo­ment. The same ef­fects that make stars twin­kle could make their plan­ets in­dis­tin­guish­able.</p> <p>“We were we strug­gling with­out any road map,” said Dr. But­ler, who earned a Ph.D. from the Uni­ver­si­ty of Mary­land in the process and is now at the <a href=\"http://carnegiescience.edu/\">Carnegie In­sti­tu­tion for Sci­ence</a> in Wash­ing­ton. “No­body knew who we were. The few peo­ple who knew what we were try­ing to do al­so knew that our quest was quixot­ic at best, and more like­ly just flat out laugh­able.”</p> <p><a title=\"NASA staff page.\" href=\"http://kepler.nasa.gov/Mission/team/coi/natalieBatalha/\">Nat­alie Batal­ha</a>, then a stu­dent at Berke­ley and now a leader on the Kep­ler project, agreed.</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy, she said, “was a San Fran­cis­co State pro­fes­sor, hang­ing around Berke­ley work­ing on a pro­gram no­body had con­fi­dence that it would come to any­thing.” </p> <p><strong>‘Like Be­ing on Co­lum­bus’s Ship’</strong></p> <p>Just when they were get­ting good at search­ing, Dr. Mar­cy and Dr. But­ler were scooped.</p> <p>In the fall of 1995, us­ing the same wob­ble tech­nique, a team led by Mi­chel Mayor and Di­di­er Queloz, of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Ge­neva, <a title=\"Times article, Oct. 20, 1995.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/20/us/2-sightings-planet-orbiting-sunlike-star-challenge-notions-that-earth-unique.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias&amp;\">found a planet</a> rough­ly half the mass of Ju­pi­ter, cir­cling the star <a href=\"http://www.solstation.com/stars2/51pegasi.htm\">51 Pe­gasi</a>, about 50 light-years away, in on­ly four days — way in­side of where Mer­cury or­bits our sun. That was a ma­jor sur­prise. Ju­pi­ter takes 12 years to or­bit the sun, and as­tronomers had pre­sumed that oth­er plan­e­tary sys­tems would be struc­tured like our own.</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy and Dr. But­ler dashed up to Lick Ob­ser­va­tory and con­firmed the new planet.

Some prom­i­nent as­tronomers ar­gued that the Mar­cy-But­ler team was con­fus­ing starspots or dou­ble stars for plan­ets. The sys­tems they were dis­cov­er­ing were too un­like our so­lar sys­tem to be taken se­ri­ous­ly.</p> <p>“For three or four years, no­body be­lieved us,” Dr. Mar­cy said. </p> <p>At one point he was in­vited to give a talk at a prom­i­nent meet­ing in Hous­ton, home of the <a href=\"http://www.lpi.usra.edu/\">Lu­nar and Plan­e­tary In­sti­tute</a>. But when he got there he was ush­ered in­to a small room where half a dozen sci­en­tists in­ter­ro­gat­ed him. </p> <p>“It sent me in­to a tail­spin,” Dr. Mar­cy said. “I was back to feel­ing stu­pid.” </p> <p>Fi­nally, in No­vem­ber 1999, Dr. Mar­cy’s group and an­other team, led by Da­vid Char­bon­neau of the <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/\">Har­vard-Smith­so­nian Cen­ter for As­tro­phys­ics</a>, more or less si­mul­ta­ne­ous­ly <a title=\"Times article, Nov. 16, 1999.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/16/us/first-direct-observation-of-an-extrasolar-planet.html?action=click&amp;module=Search&amp;region=searchResults&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry625%23%2FMarcy%2Ffrom19991001to20000201%2F\">de­tect­ed the shadow of a planet</a> cross­ing, or “tran­sit­ing,” in front of a star that al­ready had been seen to wob­ble. The com­bi­na­tion of wob­ble and blink was im­pos­si­ble to ex­plain as any­thing oth­er than a planet. </p> <p>Sweet vin­di­ca­tion at last? Per­haps, but Dr. Mar­cy still is quick to point out that the ob­jec­tions to his work were nev­er re­tract­ed. </p> <p>One of the crit­ics, Da­vid Black, an as­tron­o­mer at the Lu­nar and Plan­e­tary In­sti­tute in Hous­ton, says there is no apol­o­giz­ing in sci­ence. </p> <p>“It was nev­er per­sonal, as he seems to think it was for some rea­son that I have nev­er been able to fig­ure out,” Dr. Black said. “I think Ge­off de­serves all of the credit and praise he has got­ten for his work.”</p> <p><strong>Strained Re­la­tion­ships</strong></p> <p>By the end of the dec­ade Dr. Mar­cy and Dr. But­ler, joined by Dr. Mar­cy’s old men­tor <a title=\"Staff page.\" href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/&amp;\">Steven Vogt</a> of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Cal­i­for­nia, San­ta Cruz, and <a title=\"Faculty page.\" href=\"http://www.astro.yale.edu/people/debra-fischer\">Debra Fis­ch­er</a>, now at Yale, found them­selves in in­tense com­pe­ti­tion with Dr. Mayor’s team, of­ten re­ferred to as “the Swiss.” The two groups leapfrogged each oth­er, add­ing to the planet count.</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy and Dr. But­ler were award­ed the first Bioas­tron­o­my Medal of Honor by the <a href=\"http://www.iau.org/\">In­ter­na­tion­al As­tro­nom­i­cal Un­ion</a>, be­gin­ning an av­a­lanche of medals and awards.

The re­al he­roes in the ex­o­plan­et story, he wrote in an email, are the as­tronomers who build the in­stru­ments. “In both my ca­reer and Ge­off Mar­cy’s ca­reer, the sin­gle most im­por­tant per­son is Steve Vogt.” </p> <p>In­ter­viewed re­cent­ly, a clear­ly un­com­fort­able Dr. Mar­cy said he had been sad­dened but not sur­prised, com­par­ing the rift to the breakup of the Bea­t­les. “I would nev­er have left Paul and Steve,” he said. “They are fam­ily, pe­riod,” </p> <p>He is un­apol­o­getic about his own fame. “The news me­dia likes me,” he said and added: “I’ve been lucky. Pro­fes­sion­al as­tronomers know I’ve been in the base­ment.” Dr. Mar­cy gave the bulk of his award to Cal-San­ta Cruz and San Fran­cis­co State.</p> <p>Dr. Batal­ha, of the Kep­ler project, said the ri­val­ries of the ear­ly days of the ex­o­plan­et hunt had taken their toll. “It was a very in­tense com­pe­ti­tion,” she said. “It didn’t have to be. Ev­ery­body was rac­ing to be first.” </p> <p>The di­vorce had ma­jor con­se­quences for the <a href=\"http://www.ucolick.org/public/telescopes/apf.html\">Au­to­mat­ed Planet Finder</a>, a ro­bot tele­scope that Dr. Vogt and Dr. Mar­cy had been plan­ning to build at Lick Ob­ser­va­tory but was de­layed for years. “In di­vorce, the kids are the tele­scopes,” she said.</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy even­tu­al­ly agreed to split the time on the tele­scope with the team of Dr. Vogt and Dr. But­ler. They drew straws to di­vide the 1,700 stars on their tar­get list and 12 years of da­ta.</p> <p>“At the end of the day you try to be hon­or­able,” Dr. Vogt said.

Its mis­sion was to stare at one patch of stars for four years look­ing for the pe­ri­od­ic dim­ming that might sig­ni­fy plan­ets pass­ing in front of their suns.</p> <p>The grand goal was to find Earth­like plan­ets. The frac­tion of stars with such plan­ets is known as eta-Earth; it is a key fac­tor in the so-called <a title=\"Times article, March 7, 2008.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/weekinreview/02overbye.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;\">Drake Equa­tion</a>, used to cal­cu­late the num­ber of in­tel­li­gent civ­i­liza­tions in the gal­axy.</p> <p>If we ever have the abil­i­ty to step out of our cos­mic co­coon, the an­swer could help us de­cide whether there will be any­where to go, and how far away the near­est hab­it­able planet might be. </p> <p>Or as <a title=\"NASA page.\" href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2004/borucki/borucki.html\">William Boruc­ki</a>, who spent 20 years per­suad­ing NASA to take on the Kep­ler project, said, “We pro­vide the da­ta mankind needs to move out in­to space.” </p> <p>Kep­ler shook the sky as if it were a tree. More than 1,000 pos­si­ble plan­ets fell out in the first year. </p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy had been a mem­ber of Kep­ler’s sci­ence team from the be­gin­ning, in 2001. But it was on­ly in 2007, he said, that he fi­nally had time to start go­ing to the meet­ings. “It changed my life by bring­ing Earth-size plan­ets in­to view,” he said. </p> <p>“Ge­off is a good guy,” said Dr. Batal­ha, Kep­ler’s dep­uty sci­ence di­rec­tor. She de­scribed him as a gra­cious team mem­ber, gen­er­ous with credit and go­ing out of his way to make younger as­tronomers feel val­ued. </p> <p>When the Kep­ler as­tronomers re­al­ized in 2012 that they would need more time than planned for their sur­vey, Dr. Mar­cy put on his “lucky un­der­wear,” as he put it, and went to NASA head­quar­ters to ar­gue for more time. “This is for my stu­dents,” he said at the time.</p> <p>When Kep­ler’s point­ing sys­tem failed a year later, cut­ting short its planet quest, Dr. Mar­cy was the­at­ri­cally de­spond­ent. Bor­row­ing from a <a title=\"NPR reprint of Auden poem.\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/programs/death/readings/poetry/aude.html\">W. H Au­den po­em</a>, he wrote: </p> <p>Stop all the clocks, cut off the In­ter­net, </p> <p>Pre­vent the dog from bark­ing with a juicy bone,</p> <p>Let jet air­planes cir­cle at night over­head, </p> <p>Sky­writ­ing over Cygnus: Kep­ler is dead.</p> <p><strong>‘Chick­en Ge­off’ </strong></p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy lives high in the Berke­ley hills with Dr. Keg­ley, “wife, chem­ist, god­dess,” as he puts it on his web­site — an en­vi­ron­men­tal chem­ist and chief ex­ec­u­tive of the con­sult­ing firm Pes­ti­cide Re­search In­sti­tute. Their back­yard is home to bee­hives dec­o­rated with as­tro­nom­i­cal sym­bols, and a flock of chick­ens, lead­ing the son of one of his grad­u­ate stu­dents to call him “Chick­en Ge­off.”</p> <p>So­cial con­scious­ness is part of his iden­ti­ty. At San­ta Cruz he ran around plas­ter­ing “Men Against Rape” stick­ers over nude pin­ups in the en­gi­neer­ing and op­tics shops. </p> <p>At Berke­ley he reg­u­lar­ly hits the ten­nis courts with the women’s team. “They give me lessons,” he said. Per­haps re­flect­ing his own years of self-doubt, his web­site al­so has a sec­tion on de­pres­sion and sui­cide aware­ness. “Now I know I wasn’t alone,” he said of those dark days in Pas­a­dena. “It’s a com­mon phe­nom­enon.”</p> <p>Once an out­sider with no fu­ture, Dr. Mar­cy now has his pick of col­lab­o­ra­tors and stu­dents. “My un­der­grad­u­ates are even smarter than my grad­u­ate stu­dents,” he said re­cent­ly. He has al­so em­braced the free­dom to be out­spo­ken. </p> <p>At a meet­ing at M.I.T. in 2011, he star­tled his col­leagues with a bit­ter ti­rade about their col­lec­tive fail­ure to win ap­proval for the Ter­res­trial Planet Finder and chal­lenged Pres­i­dent Oba­ma to make a Ken­nedy­esque dec­la­ra­tion that we would send a probe to <a title=\"Image in the Times.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2013/06/11/science/11PLAN.html\">Al­pha Cen­tau­ri</a>. That mis­sion would re­vive the agency and maybe the na­tion, which he says has been squan­der­ing its tech­no­logi­cal lead­er­ship in the world. </p> <p>“Ev­ery young per­son is won­der­ing, ‘What will my gen­er­a­tion do that my par­ents didn’t do?’ ” Dr. Mar­cy said.</p> <p>His for­mer stu­dent <a title=\"Hawaii web page.\" href=\"http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/users/howard/Home.html\">An­drew W.

Mr. Pe­tigu­ra’s anal­y­sis was full of as­sump­tions and ex­trap­o­la­tions that would be test­ed and retest­ed in the com­ing years, as­tronomers said. </p> <p>As Dr. Batal­ha, among oth­ers, point­ed out, “we don’t yet have any planet can­di­dates that are ex­act ana­logues of the Earth in terms of size, or­bit or star type.”</p> <p>Dr. Mar­cy nev­er­the­less pro­nounced him­self “tin­gly,” say­ing it was the most im­por­tant work he had been in­volved in. The Na­tion­al Acad­emy of Sci­ences re­cent­ly named <a title=\"The article.\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19273.full\">their pa­per</a> as the best on the phys­i­cal sci­ences pub­lished last year in The Pro­ceed­ings of the Na­tion­al Acad­emy of Sci­ences, giv­ing it the <a title=\"Cozzarelli Prize page.\" href=\"http://www.nasonline.org/news-and-multimedia/news/2013-cozzarelli-prize-recipients.html\">Coz­zarel­li Prize</a>. </p> <p><strong>The Stars of Sum­mer</strong></p> <p>One thing Kep­ler couldn’t do with­out out­side help was to say what these pu­ta­tive plan­ets were like. By re­cord­ing those blinks, it could meas­ure the sizes of plan­ets, but not their masses and den­si­ties. Thus there was no way to know whether these worlds were bags of gas or rocks like Earth.</p> <p>That was where Dr. Mar­cy came in, along with the Keck tele­scope ar­ray and its abil­i­ty to meas­ure wob­bles and masses. </p> <p>“We’re pour­ing all our ef­fort in­to plan­ets rough­ly the size of Earth,” Dr. Mar­cy said, “not just dis­cov­er­ing but meas­ur­ing the prop­er­ties of Earth-size plan­ets.</p> <p>“The Greeks would have en­joyed this,” he added. “They would un­der­stand. This is not quan­tum field the­ory.”</p> <p>He was par­tic­u­lar­ly in­ter­est­ed in learn­ing at what size a planet went from be­ing a rock with wa­ter on it, and pos­si­bly hab­it­able like Earth, to be­ing gas, like Nep­tune. The ques­tion was of more than ac­a­demic in­ter­est, since most of the Kep­ler plan­ets are be­tween Earth and Nep­tune in size. The da­ta seemed to sug­gest, he said, that the break-even point be­tween rocky and gas­eous was about one and a half times the size of Earth. Kep­ler has shown that there are plen­ty of such worlds out there.</p> <p>But with­out the Ter­res­trial Planet Finder or some­thing like it, the search for Earth 2.0 could go on­ly so far. You could find a planet with the mass and or­bit of Earth, he ex­plained, but “how do we know it’s not <a title=\"About &quot;Waterworld&quot; \" href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114898/?ref_=nv_sr_1\">an ocean world like Kevin Cost­ner</a>, or dry as a bone?”</p> <p>Once up­on a time, as­tron­omy was a ro­man­tic and phys­i­cal­ly gru­el­ing en­deavor. As­tronomers kissed their spouses and chil­dren good­bye and de­camped for dis­tant moun­tains, where they donned elec­tri­cal­ly heat­ed flight suits to sur­vive a frigid, night­long tele­scope vigil. </p> <p>On this night Dr. Mar­cy set up the tele­scope and its spec­trom­e­ter with that tu­na can of io­dine, then head­ed home for a meal of wild salmon and toma­toes and figs from his back­yard. Thus for­ti­fied, he re­turned to watch as Keck sent da­ta from Ha­waii to Berke­ley.</p> <p>Over the next few hours, a rogue’s gallery of stars, all of them home to sus­pect­ed plan­ets, swam in­to view, one af­ter an­other. “They are my chil­dren,” he said.</p> <p>One screen showed a star’s spec­trum — a pick­et fence of dark and light, de­pend­ing on which wave­lengths of light were there. </p> <p>An­other screen showed pre­vi­ous mea­sure­ments of that star’s ve­locity cy­cle as de­ter­mined by ear­lier ob­ser­va­tions. Some looked like per­fect sine waves, the sig­na­ture of a star be­ing jerked rhyth­mi­cal­ly back and forth by a planet; oth­ers were noisy clumps of points in which one could imag­ine reg­u­lar­i­ty. Dr. Mar­cy pro­vided color com­men­tary as if he were check­ing up on old friends.</p> <p>“This is a star pulling on a star,” he said as one came up. </p> <p>He point­ed to a small wig­gle on an­other curve that sug­gest­ed a sec­ond planet where there was al­ready one. “This is frankly pub­lish­able now,” he said.</p> <p>An­other star, an old friend known as 16 Cyg­ni B came up with a saw-toothed pat­tern of mo­tion, the sig­na­ture of an egg-shaped or­bit. He re­called that he and Dr. But­ler had been in his of­fice at 4 a.m. when they first saw it — the fourth or fifth planet they had dis­cov­ered — “and it’s still in­ter­est­ing.” </p> <p>“Look at this beau­ty,” Dr. Mar­cy ex­claimed. “This is Isaac New­ton scream­ing with joy from his grave.” He con­tin­ued with a chuck­le: “This is my life. When we saw this, we were so ex­cited. Peo­ple didn’t re­al­ize plan­ets could be in el­lip­ti­cal or­bits.” </p> <p>The thought brought him back to the days of be­ing crit­i­cized.</p> <p>“It feels like a black and white movie to me, re­al­ly a hor­ror film,” he said. “I was re­al­ly dis­tressed with my­self.</p> <p>“Kep­ler taught us that plan­ets are com­mon. We didn’t know that.”</p> <p>If Mr. Pe­tigu­ra’s anal­y­sis was right, he said, the near­est Earth­like plan­ets could be as close as 10 or 12 light-years away, with­in reach of a mod­er­ate-size tele­scope. “If you do T.P.F., you will not come up emp­ty.” he said, re­fer­ring to a Ter­res­trial Planet Finder. “You’ll have a hand­ful of them. So we have our home­work.”</p> <p>By then the sky was get­ting cloudy in Ha­waii. “Bad news, but this is as­tron­omy,” Dr. Mar­cy said with a sigh as he went to look for bright stars that would punch through the clouds. </p> <p>“One thing about hav­ing a big tele­scope,” he ex­plained: “We can col­lect a lot of light through clouds.”</p> <p>It was mid­night when he moved on to the next star, one with five plan­ets.</p> <p>“This is a great thing,” he said. “I love this.” For him the night and the uni­verse were young. </p> </div>",

So con­sid­er this old pre­dic­tion, from a pair of re­searchers in Aus­tralia and New Zealand. They were sum­ma­riz­ing the re­sults of then-prim­i­tive com­put­er­ized fore­casts about glob­al warm­ing:</p> <p>“The avail­able ev­i­dence sug­gests that a warmer world is like­ly to ex­pe­ri­ence an in­crease in the fre­quen­cy of heavy pre­cip­i­ta­tion events, as­so­ci­at­ed with a more in­tense hy­dro­log­i­cal cy­cle and the in­creased wa­ter-hold­ing ca­pac­i­ty of a warmer at­mos­phere.”</p> <p>That was pub­lished in 1995, and it was based on re­search go­ing back to the 1980s. Fast for­ward to 2014. </p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/\">Na­tion­al Cli­mate As­sess­ment</a>, pub­lished last week, re­searchers in the Unit­ed States re­port­ed that “large in­creas­es in heavy pre­cip­i­ta­tion have oc­curred in the North­east, Mid­west and Great Plains, where heavy down­pours have fre­quent­ly led to runoff that ex­ceed­ed the ca­pac­i­ty of storm drains and lev­ees, and caused flood­ing events and ac­cel­er­at­ed ero­sion.”</p> <p>The fu­ture, it would seem, has ar­rived. </p> <p>Cli­mate is a dif­fi­cult branch of sci­ence, full of am­bi­gu­i­ties and un­cer­tain­ties. But sci­en­tists can just­ly claim to have demon­strat­ed some pre­dic­tive skill about many of the po­ten­tial im­pli­ca­tions of the hu­man re­lease of green­house gas­es. </p> <p>Their track record ac­tu­al­ly goes back to 1896, when a Swede named <a title=\"NASA bio page.\" href=\"http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Arrhenius/\">Svante Ar­rhe­nius</a> first <a title=\"His article.\" href=\"http://www.globalwarmingart.com/images/1/18/Arrhenius.pdf\">pre­dict­ed</a> that emis­sions of car­bon diox­ide would cause the plan­et to warm.

At rough­ly the same time that re­al­iza­tion was tak­ing hold, cli­mate sci­en­tists run­ning com­put­er mod­els of the at­mos­phere be­gan to fo­cus on the like­li­hood of heav­ier rains in a fu­ture cli­mate.</p> <p>Many peo­ple are still catch­ing up with the sci­ence, but it is hard to miss the ubiq­ui­ty of these heavy rain­storms in re­cent years. </p> <p>Peo­ple in the Flori­da Pan­han­dle re­cent­ly <a title=\"Times article, April 30, 2014.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/01/us/severe-flooding-in-south-and-midwest-as-storm-system-tapers-off.html?_r=0\">had to dodge flash floods</a> af­ter two feet of rain fell in 26 hours.

The ef­fect was seen on a small­er scale west of the Mis­sis­sip­pi Riv­er, too, even in parts of the coun­try where the cli­mate is dry­ing out over all.</p> <p>What led the re­searchers to ex­pect this long be­fore it ac­tu­al­ly hap­pened?</p> <p>Ini­tial­ly, the fore­cast was based on <a title=\"PDF of paper\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/latnp6g\">sim­ple physics</a> from the 19th cen­tu­ry. As we pour car­bon diox­ide in­to the air, the low­er at­mos­phere has to warm. As it does, it is able to hold more mois­ture, and as the sur­face of the ocean al­so warms, more mois­ture tends to evap­o­rate from it. </p> <p>In the Unit­ed States, the in­crease in wa­ter va­por has been on the or­der of 3 per­cent or 4 per­cent since the 1970s (most of the hu­man-caused glob­al warm­ing has oc­curred since then). That may not sound like a big jump, but the ef­fect is enor­mous. </p> <p>Two lead­ing sci­en­tists, <a title=\"Staff bio.\" href=\"http://www.cgd.ucar.edu/staff/trenbert/\">Kevin E. Tren­berth</a> at the <a href=\"http://ncar.ucar.edu/\">Na­tion­al Cen­ter for At­mos­pher­ic Re­search</a> and <a title=\"American Meteorological Association bio.\" href=\"http://www.ametsoc.org/boardpges/cwce/docs/profiles/EasterlingDavidR/profile.html\">David R. East­er­ling</a> at the <a href=\"http://www.noaa.gov/\">Na­tion­al Ocean­ic and At­mos­pher­ic Ad­min­is­tra­tion</a>, ran some cal­cu­la­tions and agreed that the warm­ing has, on av­er­age, put more than a tril­lion gal­lons of ex­tra wa­ter in­to the air over the con­tigu­ous 48 states, prob­a­bly clos­er to two tril­lion.</p> <p>That ex­tra wa­ter has to fall as rain or snow. But from the el­e­men­tary physics, it was long un­clear whether this would mean more rainy days over all, or more in­tense rains, or both. </p> <p>It was the com­put­er mod­els of the cli­mate that sug­gest­ed, start­ing in the late 1980s, that the an­swer would be the lat­ter, and so it has turned out. One way to think of it is that even with a lot of mois­ture in the air, con­di­tions are not al­ways right for rain, but when they are right, the skies have a lot more wa­ter to dump.</p> <p>“It rains hard­er than it used to,” said Dr. Tren­berth, who could not re­sist adding: “When it rains, it pours.”</p> <p>Re­searchers spon­sored by the Aus­tralian gov­ern­ment were the first to re­al­ly drill in­to the im­pli­ca­tions of the find­ing. In their 1995 overview <a title=\"PDF of paper\" href=\"http://tinyurl.com/mmcmr7z\">pa­per</a>, A. M. Fowler of the Uni­ver­si­ty of Auck­land in New Zealand and K. J. Hen­nessy of Aus­tralia’s na­tion­al re­search pro­gram warned that so­ci­ety need­ed to start think­ing about the risks. They sug­gest­ed tough­en­ing stan­dards for the de­signs of lev­ees and dams, and hard­en­ing roads and cul­verts against the pos­si­bil­i­ty of more flash floods.</p> <p>So­ci­ety re­spond­ed by ig­nor­ing them. For some­one sit­ting in Pen­saco­la, Fla., won­der­ing why the roads were washed out the oth­er day, that long­stand­ing re­fusal to con­front re­al­i­ty might be a good part of the an­swer.</p> <p>The warm­ing of the plan­et has <a title=\"Times article, June 10, 2013.\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/science/earth/what-to-make-of-a-climate-change-plateau.html\">slowed</a> in re­cent years, but sci­en­tists think that is like­ly tem­po­rary. They ex­pect it to get much, much warmer as this cen­tu­ry pro­gress­es, and that can on­ly mean that the rains will fall hard­er still.</p> <p>So if you are still a lit­tle amazed at what these heavy down­pours have been do­ing to com­mu­ni­ties around the coun­try, the mes­sage from sci­ence is pret­ty blunt: Get used to it.</p> </div>",

         "body" : "<div id=\"copy\"><p>On a clear, freez­ing day in Jan­u­ary 2013, Marieliz Un­win and Fran Ja­cobs sat in an of­fice above Times Square dis­cussing the dé­cor in Ms. Un­win’s apart­ment at <a title=\"Ansonia website\" href=\"http://ansoniarealty.com/\">the An­so­nia</a>.</p> <p>“There were my per­sonal items on a man­tel­piece,” Ms. Un­win said. “I have two Bud­dhas. I had a round vase. I have a pho­to­graph, black and white, of a tree.”</p> <p>She spoke fond­ly of four Phi­lippe Star­ck-de­signed Prat­fall din­ing chairs, with leather cush­ioned seats and curved wooden backs. They were about the on­ly fur­ni­ture she had in the apart­ment be­sides two mas­sage ta­bles, a day­bed, some yo­ga mats and a desk near the door that dou­bled as her kitchen ta­ble.</p> <p>“In my bed­room, I have pic­tures of my grand­chil­dren,” Ms. Un­win said, “and in both rooms, I have per­sonal paint­ings.”</p> <p>Ms. Ja­cobs was not a dec­o­ra­tor who was try­ing to find ways to spruce up Ms. Un­win’s tur­ret­ed one-bed­room, which she has called home since 1978. Rather, Ms. Ja­cobs was a law­yer for the An­so­nia, the grand old Up­per West Side build­ing. She was ques­tion­ing Ms. Un­win dur­ing a dep­o­si­tion and try­ing to prove the An­so­nia was not her true home — that, the build­ing’s own­ers ar­gue, was a farm­house a two-hour dri­ve up­state — and that the apart­ment served sole­ly as a place for her busi­ness.</p> <p>The evic­tion suit has dragged on for three and a half years. In a clas­sic case of a land­lord us­ing ev­ery tac­tic avail­able to take back a rent-reg­u­lat­ed apart­ment, the own­ers have em­ployed high-pow­ered lawyers, un­der­cov­er de­tec­tives and reams of per­sonal doc­u­ments, in­clud­ing tax re­turns and credit card state­ments, to try to force Ms. Un­win out.</p> <p>But it is al­so a spe­cial case in­volv­ing one of the city’s most rec­og­niz­able ad­dress­es, once home to Babe Ruth, Ar­turo Toscani­ni, An­geli­na Jolie and, be­gin­ning in the 1980s, more than 800 law­suits, largely due to the own­ers’ <a title=\"New York Times story on Ansonia conversion\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/08/realestate/a-conversion-plan-roils-the-ansonia.html\">con­ver­sion of the build­ing to con­do­mini­ums</a> and the ten­ants’ long rent strike in pro­test of a lack of re­pairs.</p> <p>Ms. Un­win won <a href=\"http://law.justia.com/cases/new-york/appellate-term-first-department/2014/2014-ny-slip-op-24094.html\">a small vic­tory</a> last month in this war of le­gal at­tri­tion, even as the ap­pel­late court had some un­kind words for her.</p> <p>The suit comes at a tur­bu­lent time for rent-reg­u­lat­ed apart­ments in the city. Just last week, the Rent Guide­lines Board sig­naled it was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/nyregion/rent-board-backs-raises-much-smaller-than-usual.html\">open to freez­ing rents</a> for rent-sta­bi­lized apart­ments, like Ms. Un­win’s, an ac­tion it has nev­er taken its 44-year his­to­ry. The same day, Mayor Bill de Bla­sio re­leased his $41 bil­lion dol­lar <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/06/nyregion/de-blasio-affordable-housing-plan.html\">af­ford­able hous­ing plan</a>, an ef­fort to com­bat rents that surged through­out the re­ces­sion.</p> <p>“It’s not just a roof over your head, it’s a foun­da­tion for ev­ery­thing you do in your life,” the mayor said.</p> <p>That just may be Ms. Un­win’s prob­lem.</p> <p>For three decades, she has been prac­tic­ing ho­lis­tic heal­ing, in­clud­ing mas­sage ther­apy, acupunc­ture and “non­in­va­sive mi­crocur­rent face-lifts.” At least since 2009, Ms. Un­win was run­ning her small prac­tice, <a href=\"http://www.marielizunwin.com/\">MU Nat­u­ral Beau­ty</a>, out of her apart­ment on the 14th floor. “An el­e­gant, pri­vate suite of rooms (in­clud­ing two round ones) in the sto­ried An­so­nia,” she wrote in a now-de­leted en­try on her web­site, which was later used against her in court.</p> <p>This by it­self is not grounds for evic­tion; the An­so­nia has a long his­to­ry of live-work spaces. But it is easy to see why the An­so­nia would want her out: Her rent was rough­ly $1,100 a month, ris­ing from $725 over the past three decades<strong>,</strong> and like all rent-sta­bi­lized ten­ants, she could keep the apart­ment as long as she fol­lowed the rules. An av­er­age-size one-bed­room on a high floor like Ms. Un­win’s can rent for as much as $5,000 a month, and last Ju­ly, a one-bed­room next door sold for just un­der $1.1 mil­lion.</p> <p>The big­ger prob­lem for Ms. Un­win is that she be­gan rent­ing a home in Clav­er­ack, N.Y., just east of the town of Hud­son.</p> <p>Again, not grounds for evic­tion, un­less the An­so­nia’s man­age­ment could prove Ms. Un­win was spend­ing more time up­state than in Man­hat­tan. To do so, the own­ers hired pri­vate de­tec­tives, one of whom posed as a cli­ent of MU Nat­u­ral Beau­ty. “Al­though the bath­room had some fra­grant soaps and hand san­i­tiz­er for cli­ent use, I could not find a tooth­brush or any oth­er per­sonal items that might have be­longed to Un­win,” Gayle Kern, one of the in­ves­ti­ga­tors, tes­ti­fied in an af­fi­da­vit.</p> <p>An­other in­ves­ti­ga­tor in­ter­viewed neigh­bors and ac­quain­tances in Clav­er­ack. They even dug up a pas­sage from 2004 in a lo­cal mag­a­zine, Our­town, which cel­e­brated her ar­rival in town with her new boyfriend, not­ing “they were di­vid­ing their time there with N.Y.C.”</p> <p>The An­so­nia combed through credit card state­ments to de­ter­mine how long she was out of town, in search of the elu­sive 183 days a year that would be grounds for evic­tion. This in­cluded time in 2010 Ms. Un­win spent in Chile, where she was tend­ing to her dy­ing moth­er.</p> <p>But she used the card state­ments in her de­fense to show she was out of town on­ly 97 days in the course of three years. While at the An­so­nia, she said in her dep­o­si­tion, she slept on the day­bed, which al­so served as a med­i­ta­tion couch.</p> <p>Ms. Un­win’s law­yer al­so sub­mitted her 2009 and 2010 tax re­turns show­ing the An­so­nia as her home ad­dress. But the re­turns al­so re­vealed that Ms. Un­win had claimed 100 per­cent of her An­so­nia rent as a busi­ness de­duc­tion on her tax­es, which the An­so­nia said was ev­i­dence she did not use any of the apart­ment as a res­i­dence.</p> <p>Ms. Ja­cobs and her An­so­nia le­gal team seized on this like Perry Ma­son and em­ployed a le­gal doc­trine, qua­si estop­pel, to es­sen­tial­ly ar­gue Ms. Un­win was le­gally barred from telling the I.R.S. one thing and the courts an­other. There­fore — though it de­fied ge­o­graph­ic log­ic — here was the ap­par­ent proof she was liv­ing up­state and on­ly work­ing at the apart­ment.</p> <p>Nei­ther Ms. Ja­cobs nor Da­vid Ost­wald, Ms. Un­win’s law­yer, would com­ment on the case. Ms. Un­win, in court pa­pers, said her book­keep­er and ac­count­ant were pri­mar­ily re­spon­si­ble for what was on the tax re­turn. An ap­pel­late court re­ject­ed the An­so­nia’s qua­si estop­pel ar­gu­ment, send­ing it back to hous­ing court to de­ter­mine whether Ms. Un­win should keep the apart­ment. But the An­so­nia has ap­pealed the de­ci­sion.</p> <p>While de­cid­ing in her fa­vor, the ap­pel­late court al­so re­buked Ms. Un­win. “We need em­pha­size that to­day’s de­ci­sion in no way sig­nals our ap­proval of the type of ex­ploit­ive and ma­nip­u­la­tive ten­ant con­duct sug­gest­ed by this record, con­duct ap­pro­pri­ate­ly de­scribed as ‘dis­may­ing,' ” the judges wrote.</p> <p>They did not say what, specif­i­cal­ly, had dis­mayed them, though their rul­ing cited as prece­dent a <a href=\"http://www.courts.state.ny.us/Reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_07730.htm\">Court of Ap­peals de­ci­sion</a> in which a mar­ried, un­sep­a­rated cou­ple had claimed two pri­mary res­i­dences — one spouse in Flori­da, for tax pur­poses, the oth­er in a rent-reg­u­lat­ed New York City apart­ment. In that case, the court said it dis­ap­proved of their tac­tic but couldn’t evict them.</p> <p>Ms. Un­win, who has since moved her busi­ness to a $2,900-a-month Mad­i­son Av­e­nue stu­dio, just wants it all to be over, which is why af­ter ini­tial­ly agree­ing to an in­ter­view, she de­murred.</p> <p>“You nev­er know how things are go­ing to turn out and if the judge is go­ing to use this against me,” she said. “I’ve learned to be very care­ful be­cause of this case. I’ve learned a lot about how the world works be­cause of all this.”</p> </div>",
